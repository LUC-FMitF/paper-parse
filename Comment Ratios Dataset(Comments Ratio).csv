This is an encoding of the Boulanger Algorithm and a proof that it implements
mutual exclusion. The bakery algorithm appeared in Leslie Lamport, “A New
Solution of Dijkstra’s Concurrent Programming Problem”, Communications of the
ACM 17, 8 (August 1974), 453–455.

The encoding differs from the Moses-Patkin algorithm in one respect. To enter
the critical section, the Boulanger version examines other processes one at a
time—in the while loop at label 1. The Moses-Patkin algorithm performs those
examinations in parallel. Because PlusCal does not allow sub-processes, it would
be difficult (but not impossible) to express that algorithm in PlusCal. It would
be easy to express their version in TLA+ (for example, by modifying the TLA+
translation of the code), and it should be straightforward to convert the
invariance proof presented here to a proof of the more general version. I will
leave that as an exercise for others.

I started with an encoding and invariance proof of the Bakery Algorithm. The
only non-obvious part of that encoding is how it represented the safe registers
assumed by the algorithm, which are registers in which reads and writes are not
atomic. A safe register is represented by a variable r whose value is written by
performing some number of atomic writes of nondeterministically chosen “legal”
values to r followed by a single write of the desired value. A read of the
register is performed by a single atomic read of r. It can be shown that this
captures the semantics of a safe register.

Starting from the original version of the Bakery Algorithm, it was easy to
modify it to the Boulanger Algorithm (with the simplification described above).
I model checked the algorithm on some small models to convince myself that
there were no trivial errors that would be likely to arise from an error in the
encoding. I then modified the invariant by a combination of a bit of thinking
and a fair amount of trial and error, finding errors in the invariant by model
checking very small models. (I checked it on two processes with chosen numbers
restricted to be at most 3.)

When checking on a small model revealed no error in the invariant, I checked
the proof with the TLAPS (the TLA+ proof system). The high level proof,
consisting of steps <1>1 – <1>4, are standard and are the same as for the Bakery
Algorithm. TLAPS checks this simple four-step proof for the Bakery Algorithm
with terminal proofs that just tell it to use the necessary assumptions and to
expand all definitions. This didn’t work for the hard part of the Boulanger
Algorithm—step <1>2 that checks inductive invariance.

When a proof doesn’t go through, one keeps decomposing the proof of the steps
that aren’t proved until one sees what the problem is. This decomposition is
done with little thinking and no typing using the Decompose Proof command.
(The Decompose Proof command is the real power of the TLA+ tools.) Step <1>2
has the form A ? B ? C, where B is a disjunction, and the Decompose Proof
command produces a level–<2> proof consisting of subgoals essentially of the
form A ? D ? C for the disjuncts D of B. Two of those subgoals weren’t proved.
I decomposed them both for several levels until I saw that in one of them, some
step wasn’t preserving the part of the invariant that asserts type-correctness.
I then quickly found the culprit: a silly error in the type invariant in which
I had in one place written the set of process numbers instead of the set of
natural numbers. After correcting that error, only one of the level–<2>
subgoals remained unproved: step <2>5. Using the Decompose Proof command as
far as I could on that step, one substep remained unproved. (I think it was at
level <5>.) Looking at what the proof obligations were, the obvious
decomposition was a two-way case split, which I did by manually entering
another level of subproof. One of those cases weren’t proved, so I tried another
two-way case split on it. That worked. I then made that substep the first step
of the (level <3>) proof of <2>5, moving its proof with it. With that additional
fact, TLAPS was able to prove <2>5 in one more step (the QED step).

The entire proof now is about 70 lines. I only typed 20 of those 70 lines. The
rest either came from the original Bakery Algorithm (8-line) proof or were
generated by the Decompose Proof Command.

I don’t know how much time I actually spent writing the algorithm and its proof.
Except for the final compaction of the (correct) proof of <2>5, the entire
exercise took me two days. However, most of that was spent tracking down bugs
in the TLAPS tool. We are in the process of moving TLAPS to a new version of
Eclipse, and there are many bugs that must be fixed before it’s ready to be
released. I would estimate that it would have taken me less than 4 hours
without bugs. I find it remarkable how little thinking the whole thing took.

This whole process was a lot easier than trying to write a convincing hand
proof—a proof that I would regard as adequate to justify publication of the
proof.

Given an initial population of Chameneos, the game
does not always reaches a final state in which all chameneos
have the same colour, and therefore in which no one can
mutate anymore.As a matter of fact, according to their initial

may belong to one of three possible connected components
and therefore cannot move from one connected component
to another one. Thus the evolution may end only when the
initial state is in the same connected components as one final

A classic example is in a spec that implies x and y are numbers, where

A == (x'=x) /\ (y'=x+1)

B == (x /= y) /\ (x' = x) /\ (y' = x)

Then

V1: ((A \cdot B) WITH x <- z, y <- z) equals z'=z

V2: (A WITH x <- z, y <- z) \cdot (B WITH x <- z, y <- z) equals FALSE

This is the classic example of an action A showing that instantiation doesn't distribute over ENABLED.
""For each subexpression of the form B \cdot C, replace each primed occurrence of x in B and each unprimed occurrence of x in C by a new symbol $x that is different from any identifier and from any other symbol that occurs in B or C."" (Section 17.8 ""The semantics of instantiation"" on page 338 of Specifying Systems)

V1

We first apply the above replacement rule for \cdot, followed by the substitution (WITH):

($x = x /\ $y = x + 1) \cdot ($x # $y /\ x' = $x /\ y' = $x)

($x = z /\ $y = z + 1) \cdot ($x # $y /\ z' = $x /\ z' = $x)

Thus: z = z'

V2

We apply substitution before replacement:

(...) \cdot (z # z /\ ...)

Thus: FALSE (Contradiction)

key to find one with a given key. We can most simply describe the algorithm
by assuming that the items consist only of keys, which are integers. So we assume as input a sorted sequence seq of integers and an integer val , and we let the algorithm set result to the computed output. The postcondition is that the result equals a number i such that seq[i] equals val if such an i exists; otherwise, result equals 0 . Again, to make model checking easier, we assume that seq is a sequence of values in some set Values of integers. The assumption that the sequence is sorted is expressed by requiring it to be an element of the set SortedSeqs of all sorted sequences of elements in Values , which can be defined by: SortedSeqs == {ss \in Seq(Values) : \A i, j \in 1..Len(ss) : (i < j) => (ss[i] =< ss[j])} The algorithm is in Figure 5. You will have to define the postcondition as well as the loop invariant. However, writing a correct binary search algorithm is tricky. Before looking at Figure 5, try writing your own binary search algorithm in PlusCal and checking it with TLC. It should begin with the variable declarations seq \in SortedSeqs, val \in Values, 31 --fair algorithm BinarySearch { variables seq \in SortedSeqs, val \in Values, low = 1, high = Len(seq), result = 0 ; { a: while (low =< high /\ result = 0) { with (mid = (low + high) \div 2, mval = seq[mid]) { if (mval = val) { result := mid} else if (val < mval) { high := mid - 1} else {low := mid + 1} } } } } Figure 5: The Binary Search Algorithm."

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

The Tower of Hanoi is a classical mathematical puzzle. It consists of three pegs
(or rods) and a number of disks of different sizes. Initially, all disks are
stacked on one peg in decreasing order of size, with the largest disk at the
bottom and the smallest disk at the top.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from the source
peg to a target peg, using the remaining peg as an auxiliary, while following
these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can be moved only if it is the topmost disk on a peg.
3. A larger disk may never be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The puzzle is solved when all disks have been transferred to the target peg in
the same order.


MODEL

Let:
n = number of disks
Pegs = {A, B, C}

Each state of the system can be represented as a triple of stacks:
(A, B, C)

where each stack contains disks arranged from bottom to top.

Initial State:
A = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]
B = []
C = []

Goal State:
A = []
B = []
C = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]

A valid transition consists of moving the top disk from one peg to another peg
such that the disk-placement rules are not violated.



RECURSIVE ALGORITHM

Procedure TOH(n, source, target, auxiliary):

If n == 1:
    Move disk 1 from source to target
    Return
Else:
    TOH(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
    Move disk n from source to target
    TOH(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)

This recursive strategy works by:
1. Moving the top n?1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
2. Moving the largest disk from the source peg to the target peg.
3. Moving the n?1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.



ITERATIVE ALGORITHM

The total number of moves required to solve the puzzle is:
2^n ? 1

If n is even, the roles of the auxiliary and target pegs are swapped.

Procedure IterativeTOH(n):

Let totalMoves = 2^n ? 1

For i from 1 to totalMoves:
    If i mod 3 == 1:
        Perform the legal move between source and target
    Else if i mod 3 == 2:
        Perform the legal move between source and auxiliary
    Else:
        Perform the legal move between auxiliary and target

A legal move is defined as moving the smaller top disk between the two pegs.



COMPLEXITY

Time Complexity:
O(2^n)

Space Complexity:
O(n) due to recursive call stack


SUMMARY

The Tower of Hanoi problem demonstrates recursion, state transitions, and
constraint-based movement. It is commonly used to illustrate recursive
algorithms, mathematical induction, and formal modeling of state-based systems.
