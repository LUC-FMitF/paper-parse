# Overhaul Tower of Hanoi specification #9
Overhaul Tower of Hanoi specification#9
## Description
Modeling towers as Naturals in is rather low-level/close to an implementation. A high-level spec is likely simpler to grasp if it models towers as sequences...
Current Hanoi.tla refinement for high-level spec?!
~~Add comments to and explain what it is doing~~ Moved to CommunityModules]( )
Existing comments limited to TLC module overwrite
State Hanoi problem at the beginning of Hanoi.tla in case the file is passed around without
not a type invariant because it omits that tower is a function
states that a tower is a number in 1..2^D, while the formula says it's a number in 0..(2^D-1)
And more explicit variant of how to specify logical and. It is broken when Len(by) # Len(bx)
LOCAL INSTANCE Sequences
LOCAL Max(n, m) == IF n m THEN m ELSE n
RECURSIVE ToBase2(, )
ToBase2(d, b) == IF d > 0
THEN ToBase2(d \div 2, b) \o >
ToBase10(b) == LET d[i \in DOMAIN b] == IF i = 1
THEN b[Len(b) + 1 - i] (2^(i-1))
ELSE b[Len(b) + 1 - i] (2^(i-1)) + d[i - 1]
LOCAL And2(x,y) == LET bx == ToBase2(x, >>)
and == [ i \in DOMAIN bx \cup DOMAIN by |->
IF bx[i] = 1 /\ by[i] = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 ]
