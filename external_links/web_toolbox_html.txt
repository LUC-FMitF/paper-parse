# The TLA+ Toolbox

## What is the Toolbox? [show]
The TLA Toolbox is an IDE (integrated development environment) for the TLA+ tools. You can use it to:
Create and edit your specs, with the locations of parsing errors marked in the modules.
Run the PlusCal translator, with the locations of translation errors marked in the PlusCal code.
View the pretty-printed versions of your modules.
Run the TLC model checker. The Toolbox allows you to explorer an error trace produced by TLC--for example, by evaluating arbitrary formulas at each step in the trace.
The Toolbox was written by Simon Zambrovski and improved by Markus Kuppe and Daniel Ricketts.
Users who would prefer a more lightweight IDE for TLA+ may want to try the . However, it lacks many of the Toolbox's features.
## Obtaining the Toolbox [show]
### Downloading the Toolbox [show]
Below is a link to a page from which you can download the versions of the Toolbox for various systems, the name of the file indicating which system it is for. For example, TLAToolbox-1.4.5-linux.gtk.x8664.zip is for 64-bit Linux. Please thank Microsoft and HP for the open-source release of the code by reading the following agreement.
By installing, copying, or otherwise using this software, you agree to be bound by the terms of its license.
You can download the Toolbox from either of these sites:
Put the downloaded zip file in a convenient folder.
### Installing the Toolbox [show]
Here are the instructions for the different operating systems.
#### Windows
Download the zip file into a convenient folder. Extract the contents of the file by right-clicking on it in the File Explorer and selecting Extract All. You can choose what folder to put the extracted files in; the default is a subfolder of the folder containing the zip file. Select the Show extracted files when complete option and click on Extract. The extracted files will be in a subfolder named toolbox Open that subfolder. You can run the Toolbox by double-clicking on the file called toolbox or toolbox.exe. But before doing that, you probably want to make it easier to run the Toolbox later by doing one of the following:
Create a shortcut by right-clicking on the file and selecting Create shortcut , then move the shortcut to the desktop or some other convenient location. You can run the Toolbox by double-clicking on the shortcut.
Right-click on the file and select Pin to Start or Pin to taskbar. You can then run the Toolbox from the Start Menu or the taskbar.
When you first run the Toolbox, the operating system may tell you it's not safe to run and it won't let you run it. Somewhere on the warning window, perhaps cleverly hidden, is something you can click to tell the operating system to run it anyway. If you can't find it, look the warning up on the Web or post a cry for help on the .
#### Mac OS
Download the file and, if necessary, unzip it by double-clicking on it. (Depending on how your browser and system are set up, the downloaded file may already be unzipped.) This results in an application bundle called TLA+ Toolbox.app , which you can move to the Applications folder. The Toolbox can be started by double-clicking that application.
When you try to open the Toolbox for the first time, Mac OS will probably be reluctant to let you run it. Try to control-click (right-click) on the application, choose Open from the drop-down menu, and confirm that you want to open the application in the subsequent dialog box. If this doesn't work, look on the Web or ask for help on the .
For Homebrew users, a Toolbox Cask is available with the name tla-plus-toolbox.
#### Linux
Extract the contents of the zip file to a convenient directory. Open the toolbox subdirectory. You can then run the Toolbox by executing the toolbox file in that subdirectory.
### Installing pdflatex [show]
You need to install pdflatex only if you want to run the TLA+ pretty-printer (with the Toolbox's Produce PDF Version command). The pdflatex program is distributed as part of a LaTeX installation, and it will already be installed if you use TeX or LaTeX. It may also be installed if you're running Linux. Run the command
in a command shell / terminal window to see if it's already installed. If it isn't, you can obtain it by installing LaTeX on your computer. has links to various sources of LaTeX. Here are ones that we recommend for different operating systems. Whatever method you use, you should check with a command shell that it is installed. (Open a new command shell after you install LaTeX.)
#### Windows
comes with detailed .
#### Mac OS
The web page points to simple instructions for downloading the file MacTeX.pkg. It claims that running the file provides straightforward instructions for installing LaTeX. You can ignore instructions on how to write a LaTeX document.
If you already use a manager such as or for open-source software packages, you can use it to install LaTeX. Please refer to the instructions of your package manager for details.
#### Linux
The provider of your Linux software should also be able to provide you with LaTeX for it.
### Using the Toolbox [show]
When you run the Toolbox, the instructions that appear on the welcome screen tell you what to do next: namely, read the indicated help page. For now, the help pages are the only user manual that exists for the Toolbox. Read it. Even after using the Toolbox for a while, you're unlikely to have discovered all its features. Read all the help pages. You never know what you might find in them.
## If You Find a Problem [show]
The Toolbox works reasonably well, but there are a number of minor bugs that haven't yet been fixed. The current bug repository, where you can look for known bugs and report new ones, is:
Bugs from before 2013, including many that were considered not worth the trouble of fixing, are in:
Implementing the Toolbox has involved a lot of work by few people. They were able to build a sophisticated tool in a short time by using . However, this required compromises, and there are some annoying (but not serious) inconveniences in the Toolbox because they either didn't have the time or the Eclipse expertise to fix them. So, please try to be helpful instead of angry if something doesn't work right. Report the problem if it's not already in the bug list, and help us fix it if you can. Thanks.
