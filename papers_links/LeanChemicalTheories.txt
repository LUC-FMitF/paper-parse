Interactive theorem provers are computer programs that check whether mathematical statements are
correct. We show how the mathematics of theories in chemical physics can be written in the language
of the Lean theorem prover, allowing chemical theory to be made even more rigorous and providing
insight into the mathematics behind a theory. We use Lean to precisely deﬁne the assumptions and
derivations of the Langmuir and BET theories of adsorption. We can also go further and create a network
of deﬁnitions that build oﬀ of each other. This allows us to deﬁne a common basis for equations of
motion or thermodynamics and derive many statements about them, like the kinematic equations of

Introduction

Theoretical derivations in the scientic literature are typically
written in a semi-formal fashion, and rely on human peer reviewers
to catch mistakes. When these theories are implemented in soware, the translation from mathematical model to executable code
also requires humans to catch errors. This reects the gap between
mathematical equations describing models in science and the
soware written to encode these.1 This occurs because the computer
doesn't understand relationships among the scientic concepts and
mathematical objects under study, it simply executes the code given
it. Here, we recommend an alternative: interactive theorem provers
that enable the mathematics and programming of science to be
expressed in a rigorous way, with the logic checked by the computer.

a sequence of logical deductions used to prove a theorem‡ is
correct.2 They provide a way to write a proof step by step, while the
computer veries each step is logically correct.3–8 Formal proofs are
used extensively in mathematics to prove various theories. On the
other hand, scientic theory tends to use informal proofs when
deriving its theories, since they are easier to write and understand
(see Table 1).
Scientists are generally familiar with computer algebra
systems (CAS) that can symbolically manipulate mathematical
expressions (see Table 3). These systems include SymPy9 and
Mathematica.12 These systems are used frequently for scientic
applications but come at the cost of being unsound, meaning
they can have false conclusions.
Theorem provers are more rigorous than computer algebra
systems, because they require computer-checked proofs before
permitting operations, thereby preventing false statements from
being proven. For example, a × b = b × a is true when a and b are
scalars, but A × B s B × A when A and B are matrices. CAS impose
special conditions to disallow A × B = B × A,9 whereas theorem
provers only allow changes that are proven to be valid. Theorem
provers construct all of their math from a small, base kernel of
mathematical axioms, requiring computer-checked proofs for
objects constructed from the axioms. Even the most complicated
math can be reduced back to that kernel. Since this kernel is
small, verifying it by human experts or with other tools is
manageable. Then, all higher-level math built and proved from
the kernel is just as trustworthy. This contrasts with how CAS

Historically, interactive theorem provers have been used to
logically connect advanced math theorems to the foundational
axioms of mathematics.14–19 Before computers, this “axiomatization” of mathematics was developed by hand, in works like
Principia Mathematica by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand
Russell20 – the aim is to write down a minimal list of fundamental assumptions (axioms), and then systematically derive all
of mathematics from those axioms. Computers play a key role in
modern formalization eﬀorts because they can store and verify
massive libraries of interconnected theorems collaboratively
written by hundreds of mathematicians.21
An analogous program to “axiomatize” physics was famously
articulated as Hilbert's sixth problem.22 Recent reviews have
discussed progress and unsolved questions on this “endless
road” to describe how all of physics can be derived from
a minimal set of axioms.23,24 Our vision is somewhat distinct
from this – we are inspired by Paleo's ideas for formalizing
physics theories25 as a collection of proofs, instead of aiming to
represent science as a single edice emerging from one set of
axioms (though this structure may emerge in the future). In
particular, we ask “How can we formally represent a collection
of proofs/derivations using an interactive theorem prover?”
Theorem provers have previously been used to formalize
derivations in physics: theorems from Newton's Principia,26,27
versions of relativity theory,28,29 electromagnetic optics,30 and
geometrical optics31 have been described and proved using proof

assistants. Articial intelligence tools for scientic discovery have
also used theorem provers in designing optical quantum experiments,32 as well as for rediscovering and deriving scientic
equations from data and background theory.33
Here we focus on formalizing fundamental theories in the
chemical sciences. Progress toward axiomatizing thermodynamics began with Carathéodory in 1909,34 with recent developments by Lieb and Yngvason.35 But broadly, these questions have
not been addressed using theorem provers to check the mathematics, which have seen limited use in the chemical sciences.
One notable application by Bohrer36 uses a proof assistant that
reasons about diﬀerential equations and control algorithms37 to
describe and prove properties of chemical reactors.
1.2

The Lean theorem prover

We have selected the Lean theorem prover38 for its power as an
interactive theorem prover, the coverage of its mathematics
library, mathlib,39 and the supportive online community of Lean
enthusiasts40 with an aim to formalize the entire undergraduate
math curriculum.21,41 Interesting projects in modern mathematics have emerged from its foundations, including Perfectoid
Spaces,42 Cap Set Problem43 and Liquid Tensor44 have garnered
attention in the media.45 A web-based game, the Natural Number
Game,46 has been widely successful in introducing newcomers to
Lean. As executable code, Lean proofs can be read by language
modeling algorithms that nd patterns in math proof databases,
enabling automated proofs of formal proof statements, including
International Math Olympiad problems.47,48
We anticipate that Lean is expressive enough to formalize
diverse and complex theories across quantum mechanics, uid
mechanics, reaction rate theory, statistical thermodynamics, and
more. Lean gets its power from its ability to dene mathematical
objects and prove their properties, rather than just assuming
premises for the sake of individual proofs. Lean is based on Type
theory49,50 where both mathematical objects and the relation
between them are modeled with types (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
Everything in Lean is a term of a Type, and Lean checks to make
sure that the Types match. Natural numbers, real numbers,
functions, Booleans, and even proofs are types; examples of terms
with these types include the number 1, Euler's number, f(x) = x2,
TRUE, and the proof of BET theory, respectively. Lean is also

expressive enough to allow us to dene new types, just like
mathematicians do,38 which allows us to dene specic scientic
theories and prove statements about them.
In this paper, we show how formalizing chemical theories
may look, by demonstrating the tools of Lean through illustrative proofs in the chemical sciences. First, we introduce variables, types, premises, conjectures, and proof steps through
a simple derivation of the Langmuir adsorption model. Next, we
show how functions and denitions can be used to prove
properties of mathematical objects by revising the Langmuir
adsorption model through denitions and showing it has zero
loading at zero pressure. Finally, we turn to more advanced
topics, such as using geometric series to formalize the derivation of the BET equation and using structures to dene and
prove relationships in thermodynamics and motion.

In the desorption equation, rd stands for the rate of desorption,
kd signies the desorption rate constant, and [Aad] represents
the concentration of adsorbed molecules. Aer assuming equlilbrium, eqn (2), rad = rd, and with some rearrangement, we get
eqn (3).

Lean has a small kernel, based on dependent type theory,
with
just over 6000 lines of code that allows it to instantialize a version
of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CoIC).51,52 The strong
normalizing characteristic of the CoIC53 creates a robust
programming language that is consistent. The CoIC creates
a constructive foundation for mathematics allowing the entire
eld of mathematics to be built oﬀ of just 6000 lines of code.
In Section 3 we outline the proofs formalized using Lean
version 3.51.1. We host proofs on a website that provides a semiinteractive platform connecting to the Lean codes in our GitHub
repository
(https://atomslab.github.io/
LeanChemicalTheories/). An extended methods section
introducing Lean is in the ESI† Section 5.1.

3 Formalized proofs
3.1 Langmuir adsorption: introducing Lean syntax and
proofs
We begin with an easy proof to introduce Lean and the concept of
formalization. The Langmuir adsorption model describes the
loading of adsorbates onto a surface under isothermal conditions.54 Several derivations have been developed;54–57 here we
consider the original kinetic derivation.54 First, we present a derivation of the Langmuir model given by the eqn (6), as LaTeX
equations, then transfer this into Lean and rigorously prove it. We
also discuss how these proofs can be improved to be more robust.
The Langmuir model assumes that all sites are thermodynamically equivalent, the system is at equilibrium, and that
adsorption and desorption rates are rst order. The adsorption
and desorption rates are given by eqn (1) and eqn (2), respectively.
rad = kadpA[S]

(1)

The symbols rad, kad, pA, and [S] represent the rate of adsorption,
the adsorption rate constant, the pressure of the adsorbate gas,
and the concentration of available sites on the surface,
respectively.

This informal proof is done in natural language, and it
doesn't explicitly make clear which equations are premises to
the proof and which are intermediate steps. While the key steps
from the premises to the conclusion are shown, the ne details
of the algebra are excluded. In contrast, Lean requires premises
and conjecture to be precisely dened and requires that each
rearrangement and cancellation is shown or performed
computationally using a tactic. The next part shows how this
proof is translated into Lean.
As shown in Fig. 1, every premise must be explicitly stated in
Lean, along with the nal conjecture and proof tactics used to
show that the conjecture follows from the premises. Lean is an
interactive theorem prover, meaning that the user is primarily
responsible for setting up the theorem and writing the proof
steps, while Lean continuously checks the work and provides
feedback to the user. The central premises of the proof are
expressions of adsorption rate (hrad), desorption rate (hrd), the
equilibrium relation (hreaction), and the adsorption site balance
(hS0). Additional premises include the denition of adsorption
constant (hK) and surface coverage (hq) from the rst four
premises, as well as mathematical constraints (hc1, hc2, and
§ The manuscript we rst submitted for peer review included a typo in eqn (5),
with [S0] appearing as [S]. Neither the authors nor the peer reviewers detected
this; it was identied by a community member who accessed the paper on
arXiv. Of course, Lean catches such typos immediately.

Fig. 1 A formalization of Langmuir's adsorption model, shown as screenshots from Lean operating in VSCode. The left side of the ﬁgure shows the “Code
Window,” while the right side shows variables and goals at each step in the “Tactic State”. When the user places the cursor at one of the numbered
locations in the “Code Window,” VSCode displays the “Tactic State” of the proof. Lean allows the use of Unicode symbols, so we use “S0” to represent the
total concentration of adsorption sites without needing underscores. The turnstile symbol represents the state of the goal after each step. As each tactic is
applied, hypotheses and/or goals are updated in the tactic state as the proof proceeds. For clarity, we only show the hypothesis that changes after a tactic
is applied and how that changes the goal. As an example, the goal state is the same in steps 1 and 2 since the ﬁrst tactic rewrites (rw) the equation of
adsorption (hrad) and desorption (hrd) into the premise that equilibrium (hreaction) exists. Next, we rewrite (rw), simplify (ﬁeld_simp), and otherwise
rearrange the variables to exactly equal the goal state (steps 3–5). When the proof is ﬁnished, a celebratory message and party emoji appears (6).

hc3) that appear during the formalization. The model assumes
the system is in equilibrium, so the adsorption rate, rad = k_ad
× P × S and desorption rate, rd = k_d × A are equal to each
other, where kad and kd are the adsorption and desorption rate
constant respectively, S is concentration of empty sites, and A is
the concentration of sites occupied by A. Aer begin, a sequence
of tactics rearranges the goal state until the conjecture is
proved. Note when performing division, Lean is particular to
require that the denominator terms are nonzero.
An interesting part of the proof is that only certain variables or
their combinations are required to be not zero. When building
this proof, Lean imports the real numbers and the formalized
theorems and tactics for them in mathlib. Lean does not permit
division by zero, and it will ag issues when a number is divided
by another number that could be zero. Consequently, we must
include additional hypotheses hc1–hc3 in order to complete the
proof. These provide the minimum mathematical requirements
for the proof; more strict constraints requiring rate constants and
concentrations to be positive would also suﬃce. These ambiguities are better addressed by using denitions and structures, which
enable us to prove properties about the object. Nonetheless, this
version of the Langmuir proof is still a machine-readable,
executable, formalized proof.
Though this is a natural way to write the proof, we can
condense the premises by using local denitions. For instance,

the rst two premises hrad and hrd can be written into hreaction
to yield k_ad × P × S = k_d × A and we can also write expressions of hq and hK in the goal statement. While hrad, hrd, hq,
and hK each have scientic signicance, in this proof, they are
just combinations of real numbers. Alternative versions of this
proof are described in ESI Section 5.2.1.†
3.2 Langmuir revisited: introducing functions and
denitions in Lean
Functions in Lean are similar to functions in imperative
programming languages like Python and C, in that they take in
arguments and map them to outputs. However, functions in
Lean (like everything in Lean) are also objects with properties
that can be formally proved.
Formally, a function is dened as a mapping of one set (the
domain) to another set (the co-domain). The notation for
a function is given by the arrow “/”. For instance, the function,
conventionally written as Y = f(X) or Y(X), maps from set X to set
Y is written as X / Y in arrow notion.{
Importantly, the arrow “/” is also used to represent the
conditional statement (if-then) in logic, but this is not
{ These types are easily extended to functionals, which are central to density
functional theory. A function that takes a function as an input can be dened
by ðℝ/ℝÞ/ℝ.

a duplication of syntax. Because everything is a term of Type in
Lean, functions map type X to type Y; when each type is
a proposition, the resulting function is an if-then statement.
As stated in the introduction, Lean's power comes from the
ability to dene objects globally, not just postulate them for the
purpose of local proof. When a mathematical object is formally
dened in Lean, multiple theorems can be written about it with
certainty that all proofs pertain to the same object. In Lean, we
use def to dene new objects and then prove statements about
these objects. The def command has three parts: the arguments
it takes in (the properties of the object), the type of the output,
and the proof that the object has such a type. In Lean:

For instance, we can dene a function that doubles a natural
number:

The l symbol comes from lambda calculus and is how an
explicit function is dened. Aer the lambda symbol is the
variable of the function, n with type ℕ. Aer the comma is the
actual function. By hand, we would write this as f(n) = n + n.
This function doubles any natural number, as the name
suggests. We could use it, for example, to show:

Paper
Theories/adsorption/langmuir_kinetics.html#langmuir_single_
site_kinetic_derivation):

This derivation is almost exactly like the proof in ESI Section
5.2.1; the only diﬀerence is the use of the Langmuir model as an
object. Aer the langmuir_single_site_model simplies to the
Langmuir equation, the proof steps are the same.
Using the denition makes it possible to write multiple
theorems about the same Langmuir object. We can also prove
that the Langmuir expression has zero loading at zero pressure,
and in the future we can show that it has a nite loading in the
limit of innite pressure, and converges to Henry's Law in the
limit of zero pressure
(https://atomslab.github.io/
LeanChemicalTheories/adsorption/langmuir_kinetics.html#
langmuir_zero_loading_at_zero_pressure). Denitions and
structures, as we will see in later sections, are crucial to
building a web of interconnected scientic objects and
theorems.
3.3

In the previous section, we showed an easy-to-read derivation
of Langmuir adsorption, and in ESI Section 5.2.1,† we improved
the proof using local denitions. Here, we improve it further by
dening the Langmuir model as an object in Lean and then
showing the kinetic derivation of that object. This way, the object
dening the single-site Langmuir model can be reused in
subsequent proofs, and all are certain to refer to the same object.
We dene the model as a function that takes in pressure as
a variable. Given a pressure value, the function will compute the
fractional occupancy of the adsorption sites. In Lean, this looks
like

BET adsorption: formalizing a complex proof

Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller introduced the BET theory of
multilayer adsorption (see Fig. 2) in 1938.59 We formalize this
derivation, beginning with eqn (26) from the paper, which is
shown here in eqn (7):

The l symbol comes from l-calculus58 and is one way to
construct functions. It declares that P is a real number that can
be specied. When the real number is specied, it will take the
place of P in the equation. The denition also requires the
equilibrium constant to be specied.k
With this, the kinetic derivation of Langmuir can be set up in
Lean like this
(https://atomslab.github.io/LeanChemical

k This denition can be specied in multiple ways. The pressure could be
required as an input like the equilibrium constant, or the equilibrium constant
can be specied as a variable in the function like pressure. Any of these
denitions work, and it is possible to prove congruence between them. We
chose this way to purposefully show both denitions and functions in Lean.

Langmuir model vs. BET model. The BET model, unlike Langmuir, allows particles to create inﬁnite layers on top of previously adsorbed particles.
Here q is fraction of the surface adsorbed, V is total volume adsorbed, V0 is the volume of a complete unimolecular layer adsorbed in unit area, si is the
surface area of the ith layer, s0 is the surface area of the zeroth layer, and x and C are constants that relates heats of adsorption of the molecule in layers.
Fig. 2

(10) and (11), everything besides the pressure term is constant,
since we are dealing with an isotherm, so we group the constants
together into one term.
These constants, along with the surface area of the zeroth layer,
given by s0, saturation pressure, and the three constraints are
dened using the constant declaration in Lean. Mathematical
objects can also be dened in other ways such as def, class or
structure38 but for this proof we will use constant which is convenient for such simple objects. We will illustrate later in our thermodynamics proof how constants can be merged into a Lean
structure for reusability.
In Lean, this is
(https://atomslab.github.io/
LeanChemicalTheories/adsorption/BETInnite.html#C_L):

With these constant declarations, we can now dene y, x, and
C in Lean as

numbers to the real numbers; the natural numbers represent
the indexing. It is dened in two cases: if the index is zero, it
outputs the surface area of the zeroth layer, and if the index is
the n + 1, it outputs xn+1s0C.
si = Cxis0 for i: [1,N)

(13)

In Lean, we dene this sequence as
(https://
atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/adsorption/
BETInnite.html#seq):

Where si is the surface area of the ith layer, C and x are given by
eqn (12) and eqn (11), respectively, and s0 is the surface area of the
zeroth layer. The zeroth layer is the base surface and is constant.
We now have the area and volume equations both in terms of
geometric series with well-dened solutions. The BET equation
is dened as the ratio of volume absorbed to the volume of
a complete unimolecular layer, given by eqn (14).

The main transformation in BET is simplifying this sequence
into a simple fraction which involves solving the geometric
series. The main math goal is given by eqn (15).
Since y and x are both functions of pressure, their denitions
require pressure as an input. Alternatively, the input can be
omitted if we want to deal with x as a function rather than as
a number. Notice that the symbols we declared using constant
do not need to be supplied in the inputs as they already exist in
the global workspace.
We formalize eqn (7) by recognizing that the main math
behind the BET expression is an innite sequence that
describes the surface area of adsorbed particles for each layer.

In Lean, the apostrophe aer the sum symbol denotes an
innite sum, which is dened to start at zero since it is indexed by
the natural numbers, which start at zero. Since the innite sum of
eqn (15) starts at one, we add one to all the indexes, k, so that
when k is zero, we get one, etc. We also dene two new theorems
that derive the solution to these geometric series with an index
starting at one. Aer expanding seq, we use those two theorems,
and then rearrange the goal to get two sides that are equal. We
also use the tag lemma instead of theorem, just to communicate
that it is a lower-priority theorem, intended to prove other theorems. The tag lemma has no functional diﬀerence from theorem in
Lean, it's purpose is for mathematicians to label proofs.
With this we can formalize the derivation of eqn (7). First we
dene eqn (7) as a new object and then prove a theorem
showing we can derive this object from the sequence. In Lean,
the denition looks like this
(https://atomslab.github.io/
LeanChemicalTheories/adsorption/
BETInnite.html#brunauer_26):

Here, we explicitly dene this as a function, because we want
to deal with eqn (7) normally as a function of pressure, rather
then just a number. Now we can prove a theorem that formalizes the derivation of this equation
(https://
atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/adsorption/
BETInnite.html#brunauer_26_from_seq):

Unlike the Langmuir proof introduced earlier in Fig. 1, the
BET uses denitions that allow reusability of those denitions
across the proof structure. The proof starts by showing that seq
is summable. This means the sequence has some innite sum
P
and the ′ symbol is used to get the value of that innite series.
We show in the proof that both seq and k*seq is summable,
where the rst is needed for the area sum and the second is
needed for the volume sum. Aer that, we simplify our denitions, move the index of the sum from zero to one so we can
simplify the sequence, and apply the BET.sequence_math lemma
we proved above. Finally, we use the eld_simp tactic to rearrange and close the goal. With that, we formalized the derivation of eqn (7), just as Brunauer, et al. did in 1938.
In the ESI,† we continue formalizing BET theory by deriving
eqn (28) from Brunauer et al.'s paper, given by eqn (16)

(16)

This follows from recognizing that 1/CL = P0. While Brunauer, et al. attempt to show this in the paper, we discuss the
trouble with implementing the logic they present. Instead, we
show a similar proof that eqn (7) approaches innity as pressure
approaches 1/CL, and assume as a premise in the derivation of
eqn (16) that 1/CL h P0.
3.4 Classical thermodynamics and gas laws: introducing
Lean structures
Lean is so expressive because it enables relationships between
mathematical objects. We can use this functionality to precisely
dene and relate scientic concepts with mathematical certainty.
We illustrate this by formalizing proofs of gas laws in classical
thermodynamics.
We can prove that the ideal gas law, PV = nRT follows Boyle's
Law, P1V1 = P2V2, following the style of our derivation of Langmuir's theory: demonstrating that a conjecture follows from the
premises
(https://atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/
thermodynamics/boyles_law.html). However, this proof style
doesn't facilitate interoperability among proofs and limits the
mathematics that can be expressed. z in contrast, we can prove
the same, more systematically, by rst formalizing the concepts
of thermodynamic systems and states, extending that system to
a specic ideal gas system, dening Boyle's Law in light of these
thermodynamic states, and then proving that the ideal gas obeys
Boyle's Law (see Fig. 3).
Classical thermodynamics describes the macroscopic properties of thermodynamic states and relationships between
them.60,61 We formalize the concept of “thermodynamic system”
by dening a Lean structure called thermo_system over the real
numbers, with thermodynamic properties (e.g., pressure,
volume, etc.) dened as functions from a type to the real
numbers a/ℝ. Here, a is meant to represent a general indexing
type. It could be the natural numbers if we wanted to use those to
represent states of the system, real numbers to represent time, or
anything else. The only requirement is that a is nontrivial,
meaning it has at least two diﬀerent elements. In Lean, this is
(https://atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/
thermodynamics/basic.html#thermo_system):

We dene six descriptions of the system: isobaric (constant
pressure); isochoric (constant volume); isothermal (constant
temperature); adiabatic (constant energy); closed (constant mass);
and isolated (constant mass and energy). Each of these conditions
has the type Prop, or proposition, considering them to be assertions about the system. We formally dene these by stating that,

for all (c) pairs of states n and m, the property at those states is
equal. We dene these six descriptions to take in a thermo_system
since we need to specify what system we are ascribing this property
to. In Lean, this is
(https://atomslab.github.io/
LeanChemicalTheories/thermodynamics/basic.html#isobaric):

We dene an isolated system as just a closed system and (^)
adiabatic, rather than using the universal quantier (c), since it
would be redundant.
Now that the basics of a thermodynamic system have been
dened, we can dene models that attempt to describe the system
mathematically. These models can be dened as another

structure, which extends the thermo_system structure. When
a structure extends another structure, it inherits the properties of
the structure it extended. This allows us to create a hierarchy of
structures so we don't have to redene properties repeatedly. The
most well-known model is the ideal gas model, which comes with
the ideal gas law equation of state. We dene the ideal gas model
to have two properties, the universal gas constant, R, and the ideal
gas law. In the future, we plan to add more properties to the
denition, especially as we expand on the idea of energy. We dene
the ideal gas law as an equation relating the products of pressure
and volume to the product of temperature, amount of substance,
and the gas constant. In Lean, this is
(https://
atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/thermodynamics/
basic.html#ideal_gas):

To dene a system modeled as an ideal gas, we write in Lean:
(M: ideal_gas ℝ). Now we have a system, M, modeled as an ideal gas.
Boyle's law states that the pressure of an ideal gas is inversely
proportional to the system's volume in an isothermal and
closed system.62 This is mathematically given by eqn (17), where
P is pressure, V is volume, and k is a constant whose value is
dependent on the system.

In Lean, we dene Boyle's law as
atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/thermodynamics/
basic.html#boyles_law):

We use the existential operator (d) on k, which can be read as
there exists a k, because each system has a specic constant. We
also dene the existential before the universal, so it is logically
correct. Right now, it reads, there exists a k, such that for all states,
this relation holds. If we write it the other way, it would say for all
states, there exists a k, such that this relation holds. The second way
means that k is dependent on the state of the system, which isn't
true. The constant is the same for any state of a system. Also, even
though Boyle's law is a statement about an ideal gas, we dene it as
a general system so, in the future, we can look at what assumptions
are needed for other models to obey Boyle's law.
Next, we prove a couple of theorems relating to the relations
that can be derived from Boyle's law. From eqn (17), we can
derive a relation between any two states, given by eqn (18),
where n and m are two states of the system.
PnVn = PmVm

(18)

The rst theorem we prove shows how eqn (18) follows from
(https://atomslab.github.io/
eqn (17). In Lean this looks like
LeanChemicalTheories/thermodynamics/
basic.html#boyles_law_relation):

The right arrow can be read as implies, so the statement says
that Boyle's law implies Boyle's relation. This is achieved using
modus ponens, introducing two new names for the universal
quantier, then rewriting Boyle's law into the goal by specializing
Boyle's law with n and m. We also want to show that the inverse
relation holds, such that eqn (18) implies eqn (17). In Lean, this is
(https://atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/
thermodynamics/basic.html#boyles_law_relation'):

We begin in the same way by using modus ponens and
simplifying Boyle's law in the form of eqn (17). Next, we satisfy
the existential by providing an old name. In our proof, we use
P1V1 as an old name for k, then we specialize the relation with n
and 1 and close the goal.
Finally, with these two theorems, we show that Boyle's law
can be derived from the ideal gas law under the assumption of
an isothermal and closed system. In Lean, this is
(https://

272 | Digital Discovery, 2024, 3, 264–280

This proof is completed by using the second theorem for
Boyle's relation and simplifying the ideal gas relation using the
two iso constraints.

and
Avogadro's

Kinematic equations: calculus in Lean

Calculus and diﬀerential equations are ubiquitous in chemical
theory, and much has been formalized in mathlib. To illustrate Lean's calculus capabilities and motivate future formalization eﬀorts, we formally prove that the kinematic equations
follow from calculus-based denitions of motion, assuming
constant acceleration. The analysis of physical equations of
motion, particularly those based on Newtonian mechanics, is
strongly related to the formulation of many theories in
chemical physics, including reaction kinetics,64 diﬀusion and
transport phenomena65 and molecular dynamics.66 These
concepts are essential for understanding chemical reactions
and how molecules move and interact.
The equations of motion are a set of two coupled diﬀerential
equations that relate the position, velocity, and acceleration of an
object in an n-dimensional vector space.67 The diﬀerential equations are given by eqn (19) and (20), where x, v, and a represent
position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively (bold type face
signies a vector quantity). All three variables are parametric
equations, where each dimension of the vector is a function of
time.**

(20)

As in the thermodynamics section, we can dene a structure,
motion, to encompass these concepts (Fig. 4). This structure
denes three new elements: position, velocity, and acceleration,
which are functions, and two diﬀerential equations relating these
three functions. This structure also requires the vector space to
form an inner product space, which is a real or complex vector
space with an operator (the inner product) over the eld. The inner
product is a generalization of the dot product for any vector space.
** These proofs could also be constructed using partial diﬀerential equations, but
mathlib doesn't currently have enough theorems for partial derivatives.

Fig. 4 Kinematics in Lean. Here we deﬁne motion as Lean structure that represents the relation between position, velocity, and acceleration

through diﬀerential equations that are proved using deﬁnitions of derivative functions.

By requiring inner_product_space, the motion structure inherits all
of inner_product_space’s properties and allows us to access the
calculus theorems in mathlib. In Lean, this is
(https://
atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/physics/
kinematic_equations.html#motion):

K represents a eld that we require to be either a real ðℝÞ or
complex ðℂÞ number, and E symbolizes a general vector eld. In
mathematics, a eld is an algebraic structure with addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Our vector
space could be an n-dimensional Euclidean vector space, but we
instead use a general vector eld to be as general as possible. This
allows us to describe motion in a Euclidean vector space, as well as
a hyperbolic vector space or a vector space with special properties.
In Lean, if a function is not diﬀerentiable at a point, the
derivative at that point returns zero.†† During our rst formalization attempt, we tried to dene a function to be constant by
setting its derivative to zero. However, df/dx = 0 may also arise if
a function is not diﬀerentiable at that point. To avoid this edge

†† Likewise, division by zero is dened to return zero instead of something like
“undened” or “NaN”. In Lean and other theorem provers, the symbol/is not
used for mathematical division but instead points to a function called real.div.
This function returns x/y if y is not zero, and 0 if y equals 0. Another case is the
real square root function (real.sqrt), which outputs a real number for any input,
even negatives since it is dened as ℝ/ℝ. These conventions may be
unfamiliar to scientists and engineers, but they are used for convenience and
won't lead to contradictions in a proof. Any invalid step in a proof involving
these conventions will be caught when invoking a theorem not true for its
denition. We wrestled with this convention for some time before nding
clarity in this blog post archived for ref. 68.

case, we dene another structure to require the equations of
motion to be n-times continuously diﬀerentiable everywhere. We
only require the equations to be n-times diﬀerentiable instead of
innitely diﬀerentiable for generality reasons, however, a theorem
can instantiate this structure and assume innite diﬀerentiability.
We also declare this as a separate structure, instead of in the
motion structure, to allow future proofs that require the equations
to be n-times continuously diﬀerentiable on a set or an interval
rather than everywhere (e.g., a molecular mechanics force eld
with a non-smoothed cutoﬀ is not diﬀerentiable at that point).
That way, depending on the theorem, the user can choose the
appropriate extension. In Lean, this structure looks like
(https://atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/physics/
kinematic_equations.html#motion_cont_diﬀ_everywhere):

The eld contdiﬀ states that for all n, dened as a natural
number including positive innity, and for all m, dened as
a natural number, if m is less than n, then the mth derivative of
position is continuously diﬀerentiable n-times.
When acceleration is constant, this set of diﬀerential equations has four useful analytical solutions, the kinematic equations, eqn (21)–(24), where the subscript naught denotes
variables evaluated at t = 0.

v2(t) = v02 + 2a$d

(23)

(24)

Under the assumption of one-dimensional motion, these
equations simplify to the familiar introductory kinematic
equations. Eqn (24), also known as the Torricelli equation, uses
the shorthand square to represent the dot product, v2(t) h
v(t) × v(t).
With this, we can now begin deriving the four kinematic
equations. The rst three derivations for eqn (21)–(23), all use
the same premises, given below:

The rst line contains four premises to declare the eld and
vector space the motion space is dened on. The next line
denes a motion space, M. The third line contains two premises, a variable, A, which represents the value of constant
acceleration, and n, the number of times position can be
diﬀerentiated. When applying these theorems, the top function,
which means positive innity in Lean, can be used to specify n.
The nal line is a premise that assumes acceleration is
constant. The lambda function is constant because A is not
a function of t, so for any value of t, the function outputs the
same value, A. The three kinematic equations in Lean
(https://atomslab.github.io/LeanChemicalTheories/physics/
kinematic_equations.html#const_accel) are given below (note,
the premises are omitted since they have already been given
above).

The $ symbol indicates scalar multiplication, such as when
a vector is multiplied by a scalar. We normally use the $ symbol
for the dot product, but Lean uses the inner function for the dot
product. Also, “velocity 0” means the velocity function evaluated
at 0. Lean uses parentheses for orders of operations, not for
function inputs, so f(x) in normal notation converts to f x in
Lean. The proofs of the rst two theorems use the two diﬀerential equations from the motion structure and the antiderivative, whose formalization we explain in the ESI† (these theorems

274 | Digital Discovery, 2024, 3, 264–280

weren't available in mathlib at the time of writing, so we proved
them ourselves). The third theorem is proved by rearranging the
previous two theorems.
Because we declared the eld is_R_or_C, the above proofs hold
for both real and complex time. However, we were unable to prove
eqn (24), due to the complex conjugate that arises when simplifying the proof. Eqn (24) uses the inner product, a function that
takes in two vectors from a vector space and outputs a scalar. If the
vector space is a Euclidean vector space, this is just the dot
product. The inner product is semi-linear, linear in its rst argument, eqn (25), but sesquilinear in its second argument, eqn (26).
hax + by,zi = ahx,zi + bhy,zi

(25)


hx,ay + bzi = ahx,yi + bhx,zi

(26)

The bar denotes the complex conjugate: for a complex
number, g = a + bi, the complex conjugate is: g = a − bi. If g is
a real number, then g = g. For the proof of eqn (24), we get to
a form where one of the inner products has an addition in the
second term that we have to break up, and no matter which
way we rewrite the proof line, one of the inner products ends
up with addition in the second term. To proceed, we instead
dened the nal kinematic equation to hold only for real time.
In Lean, this looks like
(https://atomslab.github.io/
LeanChemicalTheories/physics/kinematic_equations.html#
real_const_accel'''):

While we haven't proved that eqn (24) doesn't hold for
complex time, we encountered diﬃculties and contradictions
when attempting to prove the complex case. Thus, eqn (24)
currently only holds for real time.
An imaginary-time framework can be used to derive equations of motion from non-standard Lagrangians69,70 to examine
hidden properties in classical and quantum dynamical systems
in the future. By exploring these proofs in both real and complex
time, we illustrate how a proof in one case can be adapted for
related cases. Here, four proofs for real numbers can be easily
extended to complex numbers by changing the type declared up
front, and the validity of the proofs in the more general context
is immediately apparent.

Paper
engineering. We found that, although formalization is slower
and more challenging than writing hand-written derivations,
our resulting proofs are more rigorous and complete. We
observed that in some cases, translating scientic statements
into formal language revealed hidden assumptions behind the
mathematical derivations. For example, we make explicit
common implicit assumptions, such as the denominator must
not be zero when we deal with division. Furthermore, we reveal,
in a more abstract way, we have attempted to reveal the formal
denitions of equations, such as exactly how pressure is dened
as a function or the assumptions of diﬀerentiability needed for
kinematics. All of these are a result of formalizing these theorems. We concur with others who have discussed the limitations of hand-written proofs and their reliability;2,71,72
formalized proofs can provide greater assurance and
robustness.
Importantly, we emphasize that while our proofs are veried
to be mathematically correct, this verication does not extend to
the external world. This distinction between syntax (logical
relationships among words and arguments in a language) and
semantics (whether words are meaningful or arguments are true,
according to external reality) in scientic reasoning has been
emphasized by logicians such as Alfred Tarski73 and Rudolf
Carnap.74,75 For scientists and engineers, whether a theory is
true or meaningful is rst and foremost about whether observational data support it – logical correctness of the derivation is
required, of course, but this is typically assumed. Indeed, when
one of us described our BET proof to an experimentalist in
adsorption, their reply was, “but BET isn't accurate.” They knew
that BET theory does not semantically match experiments in
many contexts (in fact, much literature has discussed when BET
analysis should not be applied, for instance76). BET theory has
been a useful conceptual model for the eld, but nonetheless
relies on approximations that oen dri far from reality. In this
work, we only claim to rigorously establish the syntax of the
theories we describe. Nonetheless, Lean operating with input/
output functions can receive data from the external world,
which may open possibilities for semantically grounding its
logical conclusions in certain contexts, as well.
The Lean theorem prover is especially powerful, as it facilitates
the re-use of theorems and the construction of higher-level
mathematical objects from lower-level ones. We showed how
this feature can be leveraged in science proofs; aer a fundamental theory is formally veried, it can then be used in the
development of other theories. This can be approached in two
ways: denitions can be directly reused in subsequent proofs, and
structures can enable hierarchies of related concepts, from
general to more specic. Thus we have not just proved a few
theorems about scientic objects but have begun to create an
interconnected structure of formally veried proofs relating elds
of science.
While learning Lean and writing the proofs appearing here, we
routinely asked ourselves, “How do I close this goal? I wish there
was a way to automate this.” In fact, the rst vision for computerassisted proofs in the 1950s and 60s was to automate the process
fully;77 interactive theorem provers that “merely” check humanwritten proofs didn't appear until later. But historically,

© 2024 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry

automated theorem provers (ATPs) made progress on narrow
classes of problems (e.g., problems in rst-order logic78) but
couldn't address proofs in advanced math (except when problems
are described in such simple terms, like the Robbins Conjecture79). In short, theorem proving is like searching for a path from
premises to conjecture, but in a realm with an “innite action
space48 – traditional algorithms have been inadequate. For
complex proofs, interactive theorem provers (ITPs) have been
more successful, because they facilitate human creativity in
writing proofs, while leveraging the rigor of the computer for
checking them and providing feedback to the user. Modern ITPs
also use the computer for small-scale automation via tactics; the
human provides strategy while the computer executes tactics.
Complex tactics sometimes blur the line between automated and
interactive theorem proving. For example, Isabelle (an ITP) has
the Sledgehammer tactic,80 which takes the current proof state
and attempts to transform it into an equivalent problem in rstorder logic, which can then be eﬃciently solved using an ATP.
Recent approaches have leveraged machine learning to
expand the capabilities of automated theorem proving. Theorem
proving can be framed as a reinforcement learning problem,81,82
in which an agent is to learn an eﬀective theorem proving policy
via rewards from successfully proving theorems. “Autoformalization” refers to the translation of informal proofs into formal
proofs, akin to translating text from one language to another (but
with extremely strict requirements on the formal side).83 Theorem
proving can also be framed as a next-word-prediction problem
(“auto-complete” for math proofs) in which a database of formal
math proofs is used to train a language model to predict the next
word in the proof. Large language models (LLMs) like
ChatGPT84,85 have some emergent reasoning abilities86 but oen
make mistakes and cannot be trusted. By connecting language
models with ITPs to provide feedback, training them on proof
databases like mathlib, and deploying them as part of traditional
search algorithms, progress has been made toward automating
proofs in Lean,47,87,88 even to the point of generating correct
solutions to International Math Olympiad problems.89
This interplay between creative but unreliable generative
algorithms and the strict logic of a proof-checking system may be
a model for future AI-driven discovery in science, especially for
discovering new theories. An early example of this is AI-Descartes,
in which a symbolic regression algorithm generates equations to
match experimental data, which is then combined with an
automated theorem prover to establish the equations' “derivability” with respect to a scientic theory.33 However, in this work,
each theory required human expertise to be expressed in formal
language, and reliance on an automated theorem prover limited
the scope of theories to those expressible in rst-order logic. AI
tools that can autoformalize the informal scientic literature,
generate novel theories, and auto-complete complex proofs could
open new avenues for automating theory discovery. LLMs have
demonstrated capabilities in solving chemistry problems,90,91 as
well as answering scientic question-and-answer problems
invoking quantitative reasoning.92 However, LLMs are unreliable
– they famously “hallucinate” (generate falsehoods) and are
biased or unreliable evaluators of their own outputs.93,94 Pairing
them with external tools95–97 improves their capabilities; theorem

Our next goals are to continue building out classical thermodynamics, formalize statistical mechanics, and eventually
construct proofs relating the two elds. We are also interested
in laying the foundations for classical mechanics in Lean and
formalizing more diﬃcult proofs like Noether's theorem101 (a

The proofs in this paper were written in Lean 3,72 because the
extensive mathlib library was only available in Lean 3 when we
began. While Lean 3 was designed for theorem proving and
management of large-scale proof libraries, the new version, Lean
4,102 is a functional programming language for writing proofs and
programs, as well as proofs about programs.102,103 The Lean
community nished porting mathlib to Lean 4 and Lean 3 is now
deprecated; we recommend future proofs should be written in
Lean 4, which is more capable, versatile, and easy to use compared
to Lean 3. With Lean 4, we are bridging formally-correct proofs
with executable functions for bug-free scientic computing; we will
be elaborating on that in future work.

Paper
We hope these expository proofs in adsorption, thermodynamics, and kinematics will inspire others to consider what
proofs and derivations could be formalized in their elds of
expertise. Virtually all mathematical concepts can be established using dependent type theory; the density functionals,
partial derivatives, N-dimensional integrals, and random variables appearing in our favorite theories should be expressible in
Lean. Just as an ever-growing online community of mathematicians and computer scientists is building mathlib,40 we
anticipate a similar group of scientists building a library of
formally-veried scientic theories and engineering mathematics. To join, start learning Lean, join the online community,
and see what we can prove!

Data availability
The Lean soware used for this work is open source. All proofs
are publicly available, and hosted on our GitHub repository:
