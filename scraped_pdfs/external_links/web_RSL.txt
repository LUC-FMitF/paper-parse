# How to build
## Prerequisite
Install the latest version of for working with the repo.
Install with Windows desktop C# and C++ support. Either Professional or Enterprise edition will work, Community edition is not tested.
should be already installed with Visual Studio 2017. If you choose to install MSBuild / .NET SDK / Windows SDK, then install the command line version. NuGet is required to restore several packages before the build.
## Bootstrap the development environment
In Start Menu (or whatever equivalent), find "Visual Studio 2017", open "visual Studio Tools" folder, click "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017". A command prompt will show up, where one may run MSBuild, C# and C++ compilers.
Change to the ossbuild directory in the repo, start PowerShell, and run ossbuild.ps1. The script will restore all required packages, generate a file for package definitions, and set several environment variables.
## Build the source code
Go to any directory at root, src, or under src, run MSBuild like what you normally do. The binaries are saved at out directory under the repo root.
The projects are designed to be built in parallel. If the number of processor is 8 (check the environment variable NUMBEROFPROCESSOR), the recommended command to build is:
msbuild /m:8 /v:m /fl
The second argument sets the verbosity to minimal.
### Build in Visual Studio IDE
Once in the bootstrapped PowerShell window, one can open any project or src\RSL.sln in VS IDE.
