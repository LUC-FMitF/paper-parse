# How To Build
## Prerequisite
Install the latest version of for working with the repo.
Install with Windows desktop C# and dotnet core support. Either Professional or Enterprise edition will work, Community edition is not tested.
should be already installed with Visual Studio 2017. If you choose to install MSBuild / .NET SDK / Windows SDK, then install the command line version. NuGet is required to restore several packages before the build.
On Linux machine, install Dotnet Core SDK 2.1 or more recent version and download the latest nuget. To run nuget, install latest stable version of Mono from .
## Bootstrap the development environment
In Start Menu (or whatever equivalent), find "Visual Studio 2017", open "visual Studio Tools" folder, click "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017". A command prompt will show up, where one may run MSBuild, C# and C++ compilers. Then set the environment variable OSSBUILD to 1.
## Build on Windows platform
To build all projects, simply run build\build.cmd in a Command Prompt after cleaning up the workspace.
To open project in Visual Studio IDE, assuming the workspace is stored at C:\rd\Networking-Vega, after openning "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017" from Start Menu, run the following command to generate the solution file:
powershell ..\ossbuild\proj2sln.ps1 -Sln .\src.sln dirs.proj
Then open src.sln in file explorer or command prompt. Note that the conversion from project files to solution file can be performed to any .csproj files.
If any NuGet package is not restored automatically during the build, run the following at src directory:
nuget restore packages.config
msbuild /v:m /t:restore
Recommended way to run MSBuild is:
Verbosity level for console output is minimal.
Use all available processors to build projects in parallel.
Building inside Visual Studio or using dotnet CLI also works.
## Build on Linux platform
On Linux only dotnet CLI is supported, use the following steps to build the code:
nuget restore packages.config
