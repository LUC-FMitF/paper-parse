Why is Summerset different from other codebases...
Async Rust : Summerset is written in Rust and demonstrates an orderly usage of async programming structures backed by the framework for distributed replication.
Channel/event-based : Summerset adopts a channel-oriented, event-based system architecture; each replication protocol is basically just a set of event handlers plus a tokio::select! loop. The entire codebase contains 0 explicit usage of Mutex.
Modularized : Common components of a distributed KV store, e.g. network transport and durable logger, as well as protocol-specific parallelism tasks, are cleanly separated from each other and connected through channels. This extends Go's philosophy of doing "synchronization by (low-cost) communication (of ownership transfers)".
Protocol-generic : With the above points combined, Summerset is able (and strives) to support a set of different replication protocols in one codebase, with common functionalities abstracted out, leaving each protocol's implementation concise and to-the-point.
These design choices make protocol implementation in Summerset rather straight-forward and understandable, without making a sacrifice on performance.

## Build
Install the latest if haven't. For nix:
Build everything in debug or release (-r) mode:
cargo build [-r] --workspace [--features ...]
cargo test --workspace
Generate & open documentation for the core library in browser:
## Usage
Summerset currently assumes a Linux environment and is tested on Ubuntu 24.04.
### Launch a Cluster
First, launch the cluster manager oracle (which only serves setup & testing purposes and does not participate in any of the protocol logic):
cargo run [-r] -p summersetmanager -- -h
Then, launch server replica executables:
cargo run [-r] -p summersetserver -- -h
The default logging level is set as >= info. To display debugging or even tracing logs, set the RUSTLOG environment variable to debug or trace, e.g.:
RUSTLOG=debug cargo run ...
### Run Client Endpoints
To run a client endpoint executable:
cargo run [-r] -p summersetclient -- -h
Currently supported client utility modes include: repl for an interactive CLI, bench for performance benchmarking, tester for correctness testing, and mess for one-shot injection.
### Helper Scripts
Some helper scripts for running Summerset processes are provided. First, install uv and set up the environment:
You can find the scripts for running Summerset processes locally in scripts/; use with:
uv run -m scripts.localcluster.py -h
uv run -m scripts.localclients.py -h
And for a set of distributed machines (requiring correctly filled scripts/remotehosts.toml file):
uv run -m scripts.distrcluster.py -h
uv run -m scripts.distrclients.py -h
Note that these scripts use sudo and assume specific ranges of available ports, so a Linux server machine environment is recommended.
## Plans
Please check out the page for to-do items planned for the codebase.
Lore : is the name of an elvish archipelagic province in the Elder Scrolls series. The name also sounds like "a set of SMRs".
