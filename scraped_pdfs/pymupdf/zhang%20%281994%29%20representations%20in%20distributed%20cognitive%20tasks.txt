ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose a theoretical frame-
work of distributed representations and a
methodology of representational analysis for the
study of distributed cognitive tasksÑtasks that
require the processing of information distributed
across the internal mind and the external envi-
ronment.  The basic principle of distributed rep-
resentations is that the representational system
of a distributed cognitive task is a set of internal
and external representations, which together
represent the abstract structure of the task.  The
basic strategy of representational analysis is to
decompose the representation of a hierarchical
task into its component levels so that the repre-
sentational properties at each level can be inde-
pendently examined.  The theoretical framework
and the methodology are used to analyze the hi-
erarchical structure of the Tower of Hanoi prob-
lem.  Based on this analysis, four experiments are
designed to examine the representational proper-
ties of the Tower of Hanoi.  Finally, the nature of
external representations is discussed.

People behave in an information rich
environment filled with natural and ar-
tificial objects extended across space and
time.  A wide variety of cognitive tasks,
whether in everyday  cognition, scien-
tific practice, or professional life, require
the processing of information dis-
tributed across the internal mind and
the external environment.  It is the in-
terwoven processing of internal and ex-
ternal information that generates much
of a person's intelligent behavior (e.g.,
Hutchins, 
1990, 
in 
preparation;
Norman, 1988, 1991, in press).
The traditional approach to cogni-
tion, however, often assumes that rep-
resentations are exclusively in the mind
(e.g., as propositions, schemas, produc-
tions, mental images, connectionist
networks, etc.).  External objects, if they
have anything to do with cognition at
all, are at most peripheral aids.  For in-
stance, written digits are usually consid-
ered as mere memory aids for calcula-
tion.  Thus, because the traditional ap-
proach lacks a means of accommodating
external representations in its own
right, it sometimes has to postulate
complex internal representations to ac-
count for the complexity of behavior,
much of which, however, is merely a
reflection of the complexity of the envi-
ronment (e.g., Kirlik, 1989; Simon, 1981;
Suchman, 1987).
This paper addresses the represen-
tational issues in distributed cognitive
tasksÑtasks that require the processing
of information distributed across the in-
ternal mind and the external environ-

ment, focusing on three problems: (a)
the distributed representation of infor-
mation; (b) the interaction between in-
ternal and external representations; and
(c) the nature of external representa-
tions.  In the first part of this paper, we
begin with an introduction to the repre-
sentational effect, then we propose a
theoretical framework of distributed
representations and a methodology of
representational analysis for the study
of distributed cognitive tasks.  In the
second part, we illustrate the principles
of distributed representations and the
strategies of representational analysis
through the analysis of the representa-
tional structure of the Tower of Hanoi
problem.  In the third part, we design
four sets of  Tower of Hanoi isomorphs
for empirical investigations.  In the last
part, we summarize our major claims
and discuss the general properties of
distributed cognitive tasks.
PHENOMENON, THEORY, AND
METHODOLOGY
The Representational Effect
The representational effect refers to the
phenomenon that different isomorphic
representations of a common formal
structure can cause dramatically differ-
ent cognitive behaviors.  One obvious
example is the representation of num-
bers (for cognitive analyses, see
Nickerson, 1988; Norman, in press;
Zhang, 1992; Zhang & Norman, 1993).
We are all aware that Arabic numerals
are more efficient than Roman numer-
als for multiplication (e.g.,  73 ´ 27 is
easier than LXXIII ´ XXVII), even
though both types of numerals repre-
sent the same entitiesÑnumbers.   The
most dramatic case is probably the
Copernican revolution, where the
change from the geocentric representa-
tion of the solar system (Ptolemaic sys-
tem) to the heliocentric representation
(Copernican system) laid the founda-
tion of modern science and fundamen-
tally changed people's conception of the
universe.
Psychological studies of the repre-
sentational effect in problem solving
and reasoning have focused  on a few
well-structured problems, including
the Tower of Hanoi problem (e.g., Hayes
& Simon, 1977;  Kotovsky & Fallside,
1989;  Kotovsky, Hayes & Simon, 1985;
Simon & Hayes, 1976), the Chinese Ring
puzzle (Kotovsky & Simon, 1990), the
Hobbits-Orcs problem (e.g., Greeno,
1974; Jeffries, Polson, & Razran, 1977;
Thomas, 1974), Wason's selection task
(e.g., Cheng & Holyoak, 1985; Evans,
1983; Margolis, 1987; Wason, 1966;
Wason & Johnson-Laird, 1972), and
Wason's THOG problem (e.g., Griggs &
Hewstead, 1982; O'Brien, Noveck,
Davidson, Fisch, Lea, & Freitag, 1990;
Wason & Johnson-Laird, 1969).  The ba-
sic finding is that different representa-
tions of a problem can have dramatic
impact on problem difficulty even if the
formal structures are the same.  One
characteristic of these problems is that
they all require the processing of both
internal and external information.
However, most of these studies either
exclusively focused on internal repre-
sentations or, when taking external rep-
resentations into account, failed to sepa-
rate them from internal representa-
tions.
In this paper, we argue that inter-
nal and external representations are two
indispensable parts of the representa-
tional system of any distributed cogni-
tive task.  To study a distributed cogni-
tive task, it is essential to  decompose
the representation of the task into its in-

ternal and external components so that
the different functions  of internal and
external representations can be identi-
fied.
Distributed Representations
The basic principle of distributed repre-
sentations is that the representational
system of a distributed cognitive task
can be considered as a set, with some
members internal and some external.
Internal representations are in the
mind, as propositions, productions,
schemas, mental images, connectionist
networks, or other forms.  External rep-
resentations are in the world, as physi-
cal symbols (e.g., written symbols, beads
of abacuses,  etc.) or as external rules,
constraints, or relations embedded in
physical configurations (e.g., spatial re-
lations of written digits, visual and spa-
tial layouts of diagrams, physical con-
straints in abacuses, etc.).  Generally,
there are one or more internal and ex-
ternal representations involved in any
distributed cognitive task.
 Figure 1 shows the representa-
tional system of a task with two internal
and two external representations.  Each
internal representation resides in a per-
son's mind, and each external represen-
tation resides in an external medium.
The internal representations form an
internal representational space, and the
external representations form an exter-
nal representational space.  These two
spaces together form a distributed repre-
sentational space, which is the represen-
tation of the abstract task space that de-
scribes the abstract structures and prop-
erties of the task.
We need to clarify our use of the
term "representation".  In our present
study, the referent (the represented
world) of a representation (the repre-
senting world) is an abstract structure.
For simple tasks,  a representation and
its referent can be perceived by both
theorists and task performers.  For ex-
ample, both theorists and task perform-
ers know that written numerals,
whether they are Arabic or Roman, are
the representations of abstract numbers.
For complex tasks, however, a represen-
tation and its referent are usually only
meaningful from the point of view of
theorists.  To a task performer, a repre-
sentation does not represent anything:
it is simply the medium (internal
and/or external) on which the task per-
former performs the task.  For example,
for the Tower of Hanoi problem that we
will consider later, the three problems
in Figure 12 all represent the same ab-
stract structure (i.e., problem space, see
Figure 3) to a theorist.  To a task per-
former, however, they are simply three
different problems and they do not rep-
resent anything, though the task per-
former might notice some regularities
across these problems.  Our notion of
representation is essential for our pre-
sent studies of the representational
properties of distributed cognitive tasks.
By considering alternative representa-
tions of a common abstract structure,
we can identify the factors that affect the
cognitive behavior in distributed cogni-
tive tasks.
Our current approach to dis-
tributed cognitive tasks demands: (a)
the consideration of the internal and ex-
ternal representations of a distributed
cognitive task as a representational sys-
tem; (b) the explicit decomposition of
the representational system into its in-
ternal and external components; and (c)
the identification of the different func-
tions of internal and external represen-
tations in cognition.  The traditional
approach to cognition is not appropriate
for   the  study  of  distributed  cognitive

tasks, because (a) it considers external
representations as mere peripheral aids
to cognition, and (b) it often mixes ex-
ternal representations with internal
representations.  Furthermore, the tra-
ditional approach often mistakenly
equates a task's distributed representa-
tion that has both internal and external
components to the task's internal repre-
sentation.   This confusion often leads
one to postulate complex internal
mechanisms to explain the complex
structure of the wrongly identified in-
ternal representation, much of which is
merely a reflection of the structure of
the external representation.
Representational Analysis
Representational analysis is a method-
ology for the study of the representa-
tional effect in distributed cognitive
tasks.  It is based on hierarchical repre-
sentations, isomorphic representations,
and distributed representations.
Many distributed cognitive tasks
have multi-level hierarchical represen-
tations (see Zhang, 1992, for a few ex-
amples).  At each level of a task's hier-
archical representation, there is an ab-
stract structure that can be implemented
by different isomorphic representations.
For some levels, the isomorphic repre-
sentations can be distributed representa-
tions.  By decomposing the representa-

tion of a task into its component levels,
we can identify the representational
properties at each level that are respon-
sible for a different aspect of the repre-
sentational effect.  It should be noted
that different tasks usually have differ-
ent hierarchical structures and have dif-
ferent representational properties at
their component levels.  The key of the
methodology of representational analy-
sis is the strategy of decomposing a task
into its component levels and studying
the representational properties at each
level.
The methodology of representa-
tional analysis is fully illustrated in the
analysis of the representational struc-
ture of the Tower of Hanoi problem in
next section.  It has also been used to
study several real world problems, in-
cluding numeration systems, relational
information displays, and cockpit in-
strument displays (Zhang, 1992).
THE REPRESENTATIONAL
STRUCTURE OF THE TOH
The Tower of Hanoi (henceforth TOH;
see Figures 2 and 3) is a well-studied
problem.  Much of the research has fo-
cused on its isomorphs and problem
representations (e.g., Hayes & Simon,
1977;  Kotovsky & Fallside, 1989;
Kotovsky, Hayes & Simon, 1985;  Simon
& Hayes, 1976).  The basic finding is that
different problem representations can
have dramatic impact on problem diffi-
culty even if the formal structures are
the same.  Many of these studies either
explicitly or implicitly mentioned ex-
ternal representations.  However, they
did not consider internal and external
representations as two indispensable
parts of the representational system of
the TOH, and they did not separate ex-
ternal representations from internal
ones.  Furthermore, the hierarchical
structure of the TOH was not analyzed
in these studies.  In this section, we use
the principles of distributed representa-
tions and the methodology of represen-
tational analysis described in last section
to analyze the representational struc-
ture of the TOH in a systematic way.
Figure 2.  The standard Tower of Hanoi prob-
lem. The task is to move the three disks from
one configuration to another, following two
rules: (1) Only one disk can be transferred at
a time; (2) A disk can only be transferred to a
pole on which it will be the largest.
Rule Representations
The standard TOH1 shown in Figure 2
has two internal rules: (1) only one disk
can be transferred at a time; (2) a disk
can only be transferred to a pole on
which it will be the largest.  These two
rules have to be memorized.  The TOH
in Figure 2 also has one external rule:
(3) only the largest disk on a pole can be
transferred to another pole.  In the rep-
resentation shown in Figure 2, Rule 3
need not be stated explicitly because the
physical structure of the disks and poles
coupled with Rule 1 guarantee that it
will be followed.  But if the disks were
not stacked on poles, explicit statement
of Rule 3 would be necessary.  In our
studies we used four rules2 :
1 The disk sizes of the traditional TOH are the reverse
of those shown in Figure 2: the largest disk is at the
bottom and the smallest is at the top.  The disk sizes have
been reversed to make all experimental designs
consistent.  We call the size-reversed TOH with disks
and poles in Figure 2 our standard TOH, because all
other TOH isomorphs in our present study were derived
from this version.
2 Experiments 1A and 1B used all four rules.
Experiments 2 and 3 only used Rules 1, 2, and 3, which
are the three rules for the standard TOH.

sible configurations (states) of the three disks on the three poles.  The lines between the rectangles
show the transformations from one state to another when the rules are followed.   S1, S2, and S3 are
three starting states, and E1, E2, and E3 are three ending states.  They will be used later in the ex-
periments.
Rule 1: Only one disk can be transferred
at a time.
Rule 2: A disk can only be transferred to
a pole on which it will be the
largest.
Rule 3: Only the largest disk on a pole
can be transferred to another
pole.
Rule 4: The smallest disk and the largest
disk can not be placed on a sin-
gle pole unless the medium
sized disk is also on that pole.
Any of these four rules can be ei-
ther internal or external.  Internal rules
are memorized rules that are explicitly
stated as written propositions in the in-
structions for experiments.  External
rules are not stated in any form in the
instructions.  They are the constraints
that are embedded in or implied by
physical configurations and can be per-
ceived and followed without being ex-
plicitly formulated.  Some external
rules may sometimes depend on other
internal rules and/or some background

knowledge.  For example, the external
Rule 3 in the standard TOH depends on
the internal Rule 1, because Rule 3 is a
rule about the movement of a single ob-
ject3 .  In addition, Rules 2 and 3,
whether they are implemented as ex-
ternal or internal rules, require that
only one hand can be used to move the
objects and the objects can only be
placed on the three poles (or plates, see
Figures 11 & 12), because otherwise we
can always use the spare hand or an-
other place (e.g., table surface) as a tem-
porary holder (equivalent to the addi-
tion of a fourth pole for the standard
TOH) such that Rules 2 and 3 can be by-
passed.  These two extra requirements
are embedded in the cover stories for
the experiments (see Figure 9), and they
are not counted as internal rules.
Furthermore, Rule 2 in the Waitress
and Coffee TOH (see Figure 11) is an ex-
ternal rule that needs some cultural
knowledge: spilling coffee in front of a
customer is not a good behavior for a
waitress or a waiter (see Experiment 1B
for details).  Even though some external
rules are not fully independent and not
truly external, we still call them exter-
nal rules in the sense that they are not
stated and memorized but nevertheless
functionally equivalent to those that are
explicitly stated and memorized.
In the experiments that follow, we
varied the number of external rules.  In
Condition 
I 1  
(Figure 
11A, 
in
Experiment 1B) and Condition I123
(Figure 12A, in Experiment 2), no rule is
external.  In Conditions I1-E3 (Figure
11B, in Experiment 1B) and I12-E3
(Figure 12B, in Experiment 2), Rule 3 is
3 The four rules for the Tower of Hanoi are not fully or-
thogonal.  Rules 2, 3, and 4 are orthogonal to one an-
other and Rule 4 is orthogonal to Rule 1.  However,
Rules 2 and 3 are not orthogonal to Rule 1, because Rule
1 is the prerequisite of Rules 2 and 3.
external.  In Condition I1-E23 (Figure
11C, in Experiment 1B; and Figure 12C,
in Experiment 2), Rules 2 and 3 are ex-
ternal. In Condition I1-E234 (Figure 11D,
in Experiment 1B), Rules 2, 3, and 4 are
external.  Detailed explanations of these
external 
rules 
are 
described 
in
Experiment 1B and Experiment 2.
Problem Space Structures
A problem space of the TOH is com-
posed of all possible states and moves
constrained by the rules.  Figures 4A-E
show the problem spaces constrained by
Rules 1, 1+2, 1+3, 1+2+3, and 1+2+3+4,
respectively (see footnote 3)   They are
derived from the problem space shown
in Figure 3.  The rectangles (problem
states) in Figure 3 are not shown in
Figure 4 for the reason of clarity.
Figures 4A-D have the same 27 problem
states as in Figure 3.  Figure 4E only has
21 problem states (shown by the dots),
which are the outer 21 rectangles in
Figure 3.  Lines with    arrows are uni-
directional; lines without arrows are bi-
directional.  One important point is that
these five spaces can represent internal,
external, or mixed problem spaces, de-
pending upon how the rules construct-
ing them are distributed across internal
and external representations.  A prob-
lem space constructed by external rules
is an external problem space, one con-
structed by internal rules is an internal
problem space, and one constructed by a
mixture of internal and external rules is
a mixed problem space.  Figure 4B is the
internal problem space of the standard
TOH because Rules 1 and 2 are internal.
If the physical constraints imposed by
the disks themselves are such that only
one can be moved at a time (e.g., the
disks are large or heavy), then Figure 4C
is the external problem space of the
standard TOH because under this cir-

cumstance Rules 1 and 3 are both exter-
nal.  These two spaces form the dis-
tributed problem space of the standard
TOH (Figure 5), and their conjunction
forms the abstract problem space, which
is equivalent to the problem space
shown in Figure 4D.

Dimensional Representations
The standard TOH (Figure 2) has three
disks, which possess two dimensions of
properties.  The first is the ordinal di-
mension represented by the sizes of the
three disks, which has three levels:
large > medium > small.  The ordinal
information on this dimension is re-
quired by the rules.  The values on this
dimension are constants, that is, the
sizes of the disks are fixed.  The second
is the nominal dimension represented
by the locations of the disks, which also
has three levels: left, middle, right.
This dimension is called nominal di-
mension because only the categorical

--- Page 10 ---
Distributed Cognitive Tasks
10
information of the three locations is
needed for the rules.  (For a description
of psychological scales, see Stevens,
1946, 1951.) The values on this dimen-
sion are variables, that is, a disk can be
at any of the three locations.  The three
poles in the standard TOH shown in
Figure 2 are not essential: they are only
used to construct the external Rule 3.
The ordinal and nominal dimen-
sions do not have to be represented by
sizes and locations of the disks, as in the
standard TOH.  They can be represented
by any properties of any objects.  For ex-
ample, Figure 6 shows two TOH iso-
morphs whose ordinal and nominal
dimensions are represented by different
properties.  In Figure 6A, the ordinal
dimension is represented by the sizes of
the balls (large > medium > small), and
the nominal dimension is represented
by the locations of the balls (left, middle,
and right).  In Figure 6B, the ordinal
dimension is represented by the loca-
tions of the triangular cylinders (top >
middle > bottom).  Each cylinder has
three different colors (R = red, G =
green, Y = yellow) on its three sides,
which represent the nominal dimen-
sion.    The sizes of the balls in Figure
6A are mapped to the locations of the
cylinders in Figure 6B, and the locations
in Figure 6A are mapped to the colors of
the cylinder sides in Figure 6B.  For ex-
ample, moving the largest ball from the
right location to the left location in
Figure 6A corresponds to rotating the
top cylinder from the yellow side to the
red side in Figure 6B.  More examples of
the dimensional representations of the
TOH are shown in Figure 14.
The ordinal and nominal dimen-
sions of the TOH can be represented ei-
ther internally or externally.  If the or-
dinal dimension is represented by phys-
ical properties that are on an ordinal (or
higher) scale (e.g., sizes or ordered loca-
tions), it can be represented externally.
For example, the sizes of the balls in
Figure 6A are an external representa-
tion of the ordinal dimension because
the ordinal relation is embedded in the
physical properties (sizes) of the balls.  If
the ordinal dimension is represented by
physical properties that are on a nomi-
nal scale, it must be represented inter-
nally.  For example, if we use colors to
represent the ordinal dimension, we
must first arbitrarily assign an order to
them (e.g., red > green > yellow) and
then internalize this ordinal relation
(see Figures 14G, 14H, 14I for examples).
The nominal dimension can be repre-
sented externally by physical properties
that are either on a nominal or on an
ordinal scale, because an ordinal scale is
also a nominal scale (but not vice
versa).
Furthermore, the ordinal and
nominal dimensions of the TOH can be
represented by either visual properties
(such as size, color, texture, and shape)
or spatial properties (such as location).
The separation of spatial properties
from visual properties is significant be-
cause many studies have found that
there   are   important    anatomical  and

dimension) in (B), and the locations of the balls (nominal dimension) in (A) are mapped
to the colors of cylinder sides (nominal dimension) in (B).  For example, moving the

functional differences between visual
and spatial representations.  Mishkin,
Ungerleider, & Macko (1983) found that
there are two separate systems for vi-
sual and spatial information processing:
visual information processing follows a
projection from the occipital to the
temporal cortex, and spatial informa-
tion processing follows a projection
from the occipital to the parietal cortex.
Goldman-Rakic (1992) showed that
among the prefrontal neurons respon-
sible for working memory, some only
respond to spatial locations while oth-
ers only respond to visual properties.
Treisman & Gelade (1980) found that
the visual and spatial properties of a
stimulus are processed differently in
perceptual tasks and that location is re-
quired for focused attention to conjunc-
tive stimuli.  The differences between
visual and spatial representations may
have important implications for com-
plex cognitive tasks such as problem
solving and reasoning.  One of the pur-
poses of Experiment 3 in the present
study is to examine the different func-
tions of visual and spatial dimensions
in the TOH task.
The Abstract Structure of the TOH
The TOH has a goal, a set of rules, two
dimensions, and three objects.  Figure 7
shows the abstract structure of the TOH
(see also Figure 8, which will be ex-
plained in the following section).  The
goal is defined by an initial and a final
problem state.  The rules can vary in
numbers, that is, any subset of the four
rules or all of them can be chosen for a
given version of the TOH.  The rules in
a given set can be  distributed across in-
ternal and external representations in
different ways.  The two dimensions
can be represented by different physical
properties.  O1, O2, and O3 are the three
levels of the ordinal dimension, and
N 1, N2, and N3 are the three levels of
the nominal dimension.  An object OBJi
is described as OBJi = (Oi, Nl), which can
be at three different levels on the nom-
inal dimension: (Oi, N1), (Oi, N2), (Oi,
N 3). The three objects can be repre-
sented by different physical entities.

Figure 7.  The abstract structure of the TOH.  O1, O2, and O3 are the three levels of the ordinal
dimension, and N1, N2, and N3 are the three levels of the nominal dimension.  An object OBJi is
described as OBJi = (Oi, Nl), which can be at three different levels on the nominal dimension: (Oi,
N1), (Oi, N2),(Oi, N3).  All four rules or any subset of them can be chosen for a given problem.
The Hierarchical Representation of the
Tower Of Hanoi
From the abstract structure of the TOH
(Figure 7), we can identify four levels of
representations: problem space struc-
tures, rule representations, dimensional
representations, and object representa-
tions.  At each level, there is an abstract
structure that can be implemented by
different representations.  The different
representations at each level are iso-
morphic in the sense that they all share
the same abstract structure at that par-
ticular level.  The hierarchical represen-
tation of the TOH is summarized in
Figure 8, and the details are described as
follows.
The Level of Problem Space Structures
The problem space of a problem is
composed of all possible states and all
moves constrained by the rules of the
problem.  The TOH is not bound to the
three rules of the standard TOH.
Different sets of rules construct different
problem spaces.  Figure 4 shows prob-
lem spaces constructed by different sets
of rules: Rule 1, Rules 1+2, Rules 1+3,
Rules 1+2+3, and Rules 1+2+3+4.
Problems that have different problem
spaces are isomorphic at this level if
their goals (initial and final states) are
the same.  At this level, the formal
properties of problem space structures
(such as the connections between prob-
lem states and the total number of prob-
lem states) are the major factors that af-
fect problem solving behavior.
In Figure 4, when the number of
rules increases, problem space struc-
tures become more constrained and
problem solving behavior might
change accordingly.  The effect of the
structural change of a problem space on
problem solving behavior might de-
pend on the nature of the rules
(whether 
internal 
or 
external).
Experiments 1A and 1B were designed
to examine these two factors.  In

--- Page 13 ---
Distributed Cognitive Tasks
13
Experiment 1A, the change of the prob-
lem space structure was caused by in-
ternal rules, while in Experiment 1B, it
was caused by external rules.
The Level of Rule Representations
Given a set of rules, say, Rules 1, 2,
and 3, the abstract problem space con-
structed by them is fixed.  However, the
rules can be distributed across internal
and external representations in differ-
ent ways.  For example, Rule 1 may be
internal and Rules 2 and 3 external, or
Rules 1 and 2 internal and Rule 3 exter-
nal, or all three rules internal (see
Figure 12).  Problems that have the
same set of rules but different distribu-
tions of rules are isomorphic to each
other at this level in the sense that they
all have the same abstract problem
space. Experiment 2 was designed to
study the effect of the distributed repre-
sentation of rules on problem solving
behavior.
The Level of Dimensional
Representations
The ordinal and the nominal di-
mensions of the TOH do not have to be
represented by sizes and locations as in
the standard TOH.  They can be repre-
sented by any properties (see Figure 6
and Figure 14 for examples).  Problems
whose ordinal and nominal dimen-
sions are represented by different prop-
erties are isomorphic to each other at
this level in the sense that  the different
properties represent the same ordinal
information on the ordinal dimension
and the same nominal information on
the nominal dimension.
There are two factors at this level
that might affect the problem solving
behavior of the TOH.  The first factor is
whether the ordinal dimension of the
TOH is represented internally (e.g., by
colors) or externally (e.g., by sizes and
locations).  The second factor is whether
the ordinal and nominal dimensions of
the TOH are represented by visual
properties (e.g., size and color) or spatial
properties (e.g., location).  The different
representational properties of internal
and external dimensions and those of
visual and spatial dimensions may
produce different processing strategies
for the problem solving of the TOH.
Experiment 3 was designed to examine
these two factors.
The Level of Object Representations
The problems that are isomorphic
at all previous three levels can be iso-
morphic at still another levelÑthe
level of object representations.  At this
level, different objects can be used.  For
example, when the ordinal dimension
is represented by sizes, we can use dif-
ferent sized disks or different sized balls.
For the same reason, when the nominal
dimension is represented by colors, we
can use different sets of colors to repre-
sent the nominal dimension, e.g., red,
green, and yellow, or purple, blue, and
pink.  The representational properties at
this level usually do not have as large
effects as those at the first three levels.

EXPERIMENT 1A: PROBLEM SPACE
STRUCTURES (INTERNAL)
In Experiments 1A and 1B, we study
isomorphic representations at the level
of 
problem 
space 
structures.
Isomorphic representations at this level
have the same goal but different prob-
lem spaces constructed by different sets
of rules.  Figure 4 shows that the prob-
lem spaces become more constrained
with the increase of the number of
rules.  How does the structural change
of the problem space affect problem
solving behavior?  There are at least
two rival factors.  On the one hand, the
fewer rules, the more paths there are
from an initial state to a final state.
Hence, fewer rules might make the
problem easier.  On the other hand, the
more rules, the fewer the choices.
Subjects can simply follow where the
highly constrained structure forces
them to go.  So, more rules might make
the problem easier.  This implies that
the problem difficulty might not change
monotonically with the number of
rules.  The effect on problem solving
behavior caused by the structural
change of the problem space might also
depend on the nature of the rules
(whether 
internal 
or 
external).
Experiments 1A and 1B examine these
effects.  In Experiment 1A, all rules are
internal.  We change the number of in-
ternal rules.  In Experiment 1B, all but
Rule 1 are external.  We change the
number of external rules.
Experiment 1A has four condi-
tions, in which all rules were internal.
Condition I1  has Rule 1, Condition I13
has Rules 1 and 3, Condition I123  has
Rules 1, 2, and 3, and Condition I1234
has Rules 1, 2, 3, and 4.  We made a
restaurant story (Waitress and Oranges)
for the instructions.   The instructions
for Condition I1234  are shown in
Figure 9.  The instructions for
Conditions I123, I13, and I1 were the
same as for I1234, except that different
sets of rules were stated in the instruc-
tions.
Method
Subjects
The subjects were 24 undergradu-
ate students enrolled in introductory
psychology courses at the University of
California, San Diego, who volunteered
for the experiment to earn course credit.
Materials
Three plastic orange balls of differ-
ent sizes (small, medium, and large)
and three porcelain plates were used for
all four conditions.
Design
Each subject played all four games,
once each.  There were twenty-four pos-
sible permutations for the four games.
The twenty-four subjects were assigned
to these permutations randomly.  Due
to a limitation in the number of sub-
jects available, the first, second, third,
and fourth games always started at posi-
tions S1, S2, S3, and S1 and  ended at
positions  E1, E2, E3, and E1, respectively
(see Figure 3).  This treatment was not
expected to cause significant systematic
deviation because the task structures of
the four problems each subject solved
were different from each other, and the
games were randomized.
Procedure
Each subject seated in front of a
table and read the instructions aloud
slowly.  Then the subject was asked to
turn the instruction sheet over and to
attempt to repeat all the rules.  If the
subject could recite all the rules twice

Waitress and Oranges
A strange, exotic restaurant requires everything to be done in a special manner.  Here is an
example. Three customers sitting at the counter each ordered an orange.  The customer on the
left ordered a large orange.  The customer in the middle ordered a medium sized orange.
And the customer on the right ordered a small orange.  The waitress brought all three
oranges in one plate and placed them all in front of the middle customer (as shown in
Diagram 1).  Because of the exotic style of this restaurant, the waitress had to move the
oranges to the proper customers following a strange ritual.  No orange was allowed to touch
the surface of the table.   The waitress had to use only one hand to rearrange these three
oranges so that each orange would be placed in the correct plate (as shown in Diagram 2),
following these rules:
¥ Only one orange can be transferred at a time.   (Rule 1 )
¥ An orange can only be transferred to a plate on which it will be the largest.  (Rule 2)
¥ Only the largest orange in a plate can be transferred to another plate.  (Rule 3)
¥ The smallest orange and the largest orange can not be placed on a single plate unless
the medium sized orange is also on that plate (Rule 4).
How would the waitress do this?  That is, you solve the problem and show the movement of
oranges the waitress has to do to go from the arrangement shown in Diagram 1 to the
arrangement shown in Diagram 2.
Diagram 1
Diagram 2
Figure 9.  The instructions for the I1234 condition in Experiment 1A.  The instructions for other three
conditions were the same as the one shown here, except that different sets of rules were stated.
without error, the subject was in-
structed to start the games.  Otherwise
the subject reread the instructions and
was again tested.  The cycle continued
until the subject reached the criterion.
The final states were presented to the
subject in diagrams.  A subjectÕs hand
movements and speech were recorded
by a video camera.  The solution time,
which was from the time the experi-
menter said "start" to when the subject
finished the last move, was recorded by
a timer synchronized with the video
camera.
Results
The results are shown in Figure 10.  The
minimum numbers of steps from the
starting state to the final state are 2, 4, 7,
and 8 for Conditions I1, I13, I123, and
I1234, respectively.  In order to make
meaningful comparisons, solution
times, solution steps, and errors for
each condition were normalized by be-
ing divided by the number of mini-
mum steps for each condition.  The p
values of the main effects and multiple
comparisons are shown in the upper
half of Table 1.  When solution times
and errors are used as the difficulty
measurements, the difficulty order was,
from easiest to hardest: I1 < I13 < I1234 £
I123.  The difference between I1234  and
I123 was not statistically significant.
When solution steps are used as the dif-
ficulty measurement, the difficulty or-
der remained the same (I1 < I13 £ I1234
< I123), but in this case the difference be-
tween I13 and I1234 was not statistically
significant.

EXPERIMENT 1B: PROBLEM SPACE
STRUCTURES (EXTERNAL)
Experiment 1B was exactly the same as
Experiment 1A, except that Rules 2, 3,
and 4 were external rather than inter-
nal.  There were also four conditions.
In Condition I1  (Waitress and Oranges,
Figure 11A), Rule 1 was the only inter-
nal rule.  In Condition I1-E3 (Waitress
and Straws, Figure 11B), Rule 1 was in-
ternal and Rule 3 was external.  A
smaller straw could be dropped into a
larger straw and a larger straw could be
placed outside (around) a smaller straw
(that is, Rule 2 was not implemented
here).  However, the diameters of the
three straws were so small (1 cm, 1.5 cm,
and 2 cm, respectively) that a smaller
straw inside a larger one could not be
moved out without the larger straw be-
ing moved away first (external Rule 3).
In Condition I1-E23 (Waitress and
Coffee, Figure 11C), Rule 1 was internal
and Rules 2 and 3 were external.  All
cups were filled with coffee.  A smaller
cup could not be placed on the top of a
larger cup (external Rule 2), as this
would cause the coffee to spill.  All sub-
jects understood that spilling coffee was
not a good behavior because they had to
imagine that they were waitresses or
waiters working in a restaurant (see the
cover story in Figure 9).  In this sense,
Rule 2 was not a truly external rule
with rigid physical constraints, but an
external rule grounded in cultural
knowledge.  Rule 3 in this condition
was external because a cup could not be
moved if there was another cup on its
top.  In Condition I1-E234 (Waitress and
Tea, Figure 11D), Rule 1 was internal
and Rules 2, 3, and 4 were external.  All
cups were filled with tea.  Rules 2 and 3
in this condition were external for the
same reason described in Condition I1-
E23:  a smaller cup could not be placed
on the top of a larger one (Rule 2), and
only the largest (topmost) cup could be
moved (Rule 3).  Rule 4 were external
because the bottom of the largest cup
was smaller than the top of the smallest
cup and the bottom of the smallest cup
was smaller than the top of the largest
cup, that is, the largest cup and the
smallest cup could not be placed on the
top of each other.
The instructions for these four
conditions were the same as for the
I1234  condition in Experiment 1A, ex-
cept that different words for different
materials were used and only internal
Rule 1 was stated in the instructions (all
other rules were not stated because they
were external).

Method
Subjects
The subjects were 24 undergradu-
ate students enrolled in introductory
psychology courses at the University of
California, San Diego, who volunteered
for the experiment to earn course credit.
Materials
Materials for Condition I1  were
the same as in Experiment 1A.  In
Condition I1-E3, the straws and tiny
plates were made from paperboard.  The
diameters and heights of the small,
medium, and large straws were approx-
imately 1 cm, 1.5 cm, and 2 cm, and 3
cm, 6 cm, and 9 cm, respectively.  In
Condition I1-E23, three plastic cups of
different sizes (small, medium, and
large) and three paper plates were used.
All three cups were filled with coffee.
In Condition I1-E234, three cups made
from metal cans and three paper plates
were used.  All three cups were filled
with tea.
Design and Procedure
The design and procedure were the
same as in Experiment 1A.
Results
The results are shown in Figure 10.  The
solution times, solution steps, and er-
rors for all four conditions were nor-
malized by being divided by the mini-
mum number of steps for each condi-
tion, as in Experiment 1A.  The p values
of the main effects and multiple com-
parisons are shown in the lower half of
Table 1.  If solution times are used as
the difficulty measurement, the diffi-
culty order was, from easiest to hardest:
I1 < I1-E3 £ I1-E23 < I1-E234.  The differ-
ence between I1-E3 and I1-E23 is not sta-
tistically significant.  If solution steps
are used as the difficulty measurement,
the difficulty order remained the same
(I1 < I1-E3 < I1-E23 £ I1-E234), but the
difference between I1-E23 and I1-E234 is
not statistically significant.  Subjects
didnÕt make any errors in this experi-
ment.
Discussion
From the results of Experiments 1A and
1B, we can see that problem space struc-
ture is an important factor of problem
difficulty.  For example, the solution
time difference between the easiest
problem (I1) and the hardest problem
(I123) can be as large as a ratio of one to
ten.  We can also see that the effect of
the structural change of a problem space
on problem solving behavior depended
on the nature of the rules.  When all
but one rule were external (Experiment
1B), a problem became more difficult
when its problem space became more
constrained (more rules).  However,
when 
all 
rules 
were 
internal
(Experiment 1A), the hardest problem
was neither the most constrained one
(I1234) nor the least constrained one
(I1), but the intermediately constrained
problem (I123).
Two factors, working memory and
problem structure, might contribute to
the different difficulty orders caused by
the nature of rules.  In Experiment 1A,
all rules were internal.  The working
memory load was high for both I123
and I1234  (three and four internal
rules, respectively).  One possible expla-
nation is that subjects could not do
much planning because most of the
working memory was loaded by the
processing of the internal rules.  In this
case, the structure of the problem space
might be the dominant factor of prob-
lem difficulty.  Moves were to a large
extent guided by the structure of the
problem space.  I1234 was easier than

--- Page 20 ---
Distributed Cognitive Tasks
20
I123 problem because it was more con-
strained than I123 .  In Experiment 1B,
all but Rule 1 were external.  In this
case, planning was probably the domi-
nant factor of problem difficulty because
there was little load on working mem-
ory.  This explains why I1-E23 was easier
than I1-E234, even though I1-E234 was
more constrained than I1-E23.
All four rules in Experiment 1A
were internal and three of the four
rules in Experiment 1B were external.
Comparing the results in these two ex-
periments, we found that the condi-
tions with external rules in Experiment
1B were easier than their corresponding
conditions with internal rules in
Experiment 1A.  In other words, exter-
nal rules could make problems easier.
This was explicitly tested in Experiment
2, which follows.
 EXPERIMENT 2: THE DISTRIBUTED
REPRESENTATION OF RULES
In this experiment, we study isomor-
phic representations at the level of rule
representations.  We have shown that a
problem space is constructed by a set of
rules.  Given the same set of rules, the
abstract problem space is fixed.
However, the rules can be distributed
across internal and external representa-
tions in different ways.  Different distri-
butions may have different effects on
problem solving behavior, even if the
formal structures are the same.  This
experiment examines these effects.  Our
hypothesis is that the more rules are
distributed  in  the external  representa-
tion, the  easier the problem.
There were three conditions in this
experiment, which all had three rules.
Though the three rules were the same
in their abstract forms, they were dis-
tributed across internal and external
representations in different ways.  In
the I123 (Waitress and Oranges ) condi-
tion (Figure 12A), Rules 1, 2, and 3 were
all internal.  In the I12-E3 (Waitress and
Donuts) condition (Figure 12B), Rules 1
and 2 were internal, and Rule 3 was ex-
ternal.  This is the standard TOH.  Rule
3 was external because the physical con-
straints (coupled with Rule 1) guaran-
teed that it was followed (see the previ-
ous discussion in the section R u l e
Representations for more explanations).
In the I1-E23 (Waitress and Coffee) con-
dition (Figure 12C), Rule 1 was internal,
and Rules 2 and 3 were external.  This
was identical to the I1-E23 condtion in
Experiment 2B.  The instructions for all
three conditions were the same as for
the I1234 condition in Experiment 1A,
except that different words suitable for
the materials used in the current exper-
iment were used and that only internal
rules were stated in the current instruc-
tions (external rules need not be stated
explicitly).
Method
Subjects
The subjects were 18 undergradu-
ate students enrolled in introductory
psychology courses at the University of
California, San Diego who volunteered
for the experiment to earn course credit.
Materials
The materials in the I123 condition
were the same as in the I123 condition
in Experiment 1A.  In the I12-E3 condi-
tion, three plastic rings of different sizes
(small, medium, and large) and three
plastic poles were used.  The materials
in the I1-E23 condition were the same as
in the I1-E23 condition in Experiment
1B.

Design
Each subject played all three games,
one for each of the three conditions,
once in a randomized order (e.g., I1-E23,
I123, I12-E3).  There were six possible
permutations for the three games.  Each
permutation was assigned to a subject
randomly.  There were a total of eigh-
teen subjects.  Due to a limitation in the
number of subjects available, the start-
ing and ending positions were not ran-
domized.  That is, for each subject, the
first, the second, and the third games
always started at positions S1, S2, and S3
and ended at positions E1, E2, and E3,
respectively (see Figure 3).  The starting
and ending positions should not cause
significant systematic deviation because
the three pairs of starting and ending
positions were exactly symmetric, and
the order of the three games played by
each subject was randomized.
Procedure
The procedure was the same as in
Experiment 1A.
Results
The average solution times, solution
steps, and errors are shown in Figure 13.
The p values for the main effects and
multiple comparisons are shown in
Table 2.  Problem difficulty measured in
solution times, steps, and errors for the
three problems was consistent.  The
more rules were external, the easier the
problem.  The order of difficulty was,
from hardest to easiest: I123 > I12-E3 ³
I1-E23.  The difference between I12-E3
and I1-E23 was not statistically signifi-
cant.  All errors made were for internal
rules: none were for external rules.

Two of the three conditions in the pre-
sent experiment, I123 and I12-E3, were
modifications of the Dish-move and
Peg-move problems of Kotovsky, Hayes,
and Simon (1985).  The results from the
present study are consistent with their
results: subjects took more time to solve
I123 than I12-E3.  Kotovsky, Hayes, and
Simon only reported solution times in
their study.  The numbers of steps and
errors in the present study are all con-
sistent with solution times.  In the pre-
sent experiment, the more rules exter-
nalized, the easier the problem.  In addi-
tion, external rules seem to be error
proof: subject did not make any errors
for external rules.  This effect might be
due to the fact that the external rules
were either perceptually available or
physically constrained.  The errors for
internal errors might be caused by the
load of working memory.

Why did external rules make prob-
lems easier?  There might be two fac-
tors.  The first is the checking of rules
before each move.  External rules can be
checked by perceptual inspection, while
internal rules must be checked men-
tally.  The processing of internal rules
in the mind, which demands more re-
sources of working memory, might in-
terfere with other processes critical for
problem solving, such as planning.  The
second factor is the recursive strategyÑ
the strategy to reduce a three-object
problem to a two-object problem, or in
other words, move the smallest object
to its destination first.  From the prob-
lem space of the TOH (Figure 3) we can
see that for any pair of starting and end-
ing states, as long as either the small or
the medium object is in its final state,
only three more steps are needed to
solve the problem.  Among the fifty-
four games played by the eighteen sub-
jects, the last three steps were solved in
three steps in fifty-two games and in
five 
steps 
in 
only 
two 
games.
Therefore, if either the small or the
medium object is in the final state, the
game is virtually solved.  Rule 2 might
be critical for the discovery of the recur-
sive strategy.  For the I1-E23 condition,
Rule 2 was external: a smaller cup of
coffee could not be placed on the top of
a larger one.  This external representa-
tion might have prompted the subjects
that the smallest cup had to be moved
to its final state first.  Out of the eigh-
teen games for the I1-E23 condition, six-
teen were solved by moving the small-
est cup to its final state first.  The other
two were solved by moving the
medium sized cup to its final state first.

For the I123 and the I12-E3 conditions,
Rule 2 was internal.  Thus, the recur-
sive strategy was harder to discover.
Out of the eighteen games for the I123
condition, only eleven were solved by
moving the smallest object to its final
state first.  The other seven were solved
by moving the medium sized object to
its final state first.  Similarly, out of the
eighteen games for the I12-E3 condition,
the numbers for the two cases were ten
and eight, respectively.  Thus, the ease
of discovering the recursive strategy in
the I1-E23 condition might have also
contributed to the difficulty order.
EXPERIMENT 3: DIMENSIONAL
REPRESENTATIONS
In this experiment, we study isomor-
phic representations at the level of di-
mensional representations.  The ordi-
nal and nominal dimensions of the
TOH can be represented by any proper-
ties.  We chose size, location, and color
to represent these two dimensions,
which generated nine isomorphic rep-
resentations of the TOH (Figure 14).
(See Figure 6 as well as Figure 14 for ex-
planations on the dimensional repre-
sentations and the mappings between
dimensions).
The nine isomorphs in Figure 14
were the nine conditions of this exper-
iment, which had the same three inter-
nal rules.  Among these nine iso-
morphs, some might be easier than
others.  We consider two factors of prob-
lem difficulty.  The first factor is the na-
ture (internal or external) of the ordinal
dimension.  The ordinal dimension is
represented externally by sizes and
(ordered) locations, because the ordinal
relation is embedded in the physical
properties of sizes and locations.  But it
is represented internally by colors, be-
cause the order of colors is arbitrary and
has to be internalized.  (The nominal
dimension is represented externally by
sizes, locations, and colors.)  The second
factor is whether the ordinal and nom-
inal dimensions are represented by vi-
sual properties (sizes and colors) or spa-
tial properties (locations).  The instruc-
tions for the O(size)-N(size) condition
are shown in Figure 15.  The instruc-
tions for other conditions were the
same as for the O(size)-N(size) condi-
tion, except that modifications were
made for different materials used in dif-
ferent conditions.
We hypothesize that external di-
mensions need less mental processing
than internal dimensions, and that spa-
tial dimensions support more efficient
perceptual processing than visual di-
mensions.  Thus, we have the follow-
ing predictions.  For the ordinal dimen-
sion, sizes should be better than colors
because the former represents the ordi-
nal dimension externally while the lat-
ter represents it internally, and loca-
tions should better than sizes because
the former is a spatial dimension while
the latter is a visual dimension.  In ad-
dition, locations should be better than
colors because the former is not only an
external dimension but also a spatial
dimension.  For the nominal dimen-
sion, locations should be better than
sizes and colors because the former is a
spatial dimension while latter two are
visual dimensions.  Sizes and colors
should not differ from each other be-
cause they are both visual dimensions.

Legend has it that in ancient India there was a Buddhist scripture in a locked
crypt hidden in a cave.  Many people tried to acquire it because it possessed the secret of
life.  However, none of them succeeded because if the crypt was not opened in a very
short time, it would disappear.  The lock of the crypt was remotely controlled by three
magic triangular cylinders of different sizes (small, medium, and large).  On the three
sides of each cylinder, there were three different sized circles (also small, medium, and
large).  In order to open the crypt, one had to rotate the three cylinders to a specific
configuration, strictly following a set of rules.    One day, a wise monk entered the cave.
Inspired by the wisdom of Buddha,  he skillfully opened the crypt within the specified
time.  How did he do it?  You are given a replica of the magic cylinders.  Try to solve
this puzzle as fast as you can.  The rules are given below.  The initial configuration you
will start with and the final configuration that opens the lock will be given to you
when you have memorized these rules.
Rule 1: Only one cylinder can be rotated at a time.
Rule 2: After rotating a cylinder, if the new facing side has a same sized circle
as that  of another cylinder, the size of the cylinder you rotated must be
larger.
Rule 3: Before rotating a cylinder, if any cylinders have matching sized circles
facing you, only the largest cylinder can be rotated.

were the same as the one shown here, except that modifications were made for different objects in
different conditions.
Method
Subjects
The subjects were 36 undergradu-
ate students at the University of
California, San Diego who were paid for
participating in this experiment.
Materials
The triangular cylinders in Figure
14 were made from paperboard and
could be rotated around their vertical
axes.  In Figures 14D and 14F, the three
cylinders were stacked on a vertical rod.
In Figure 14B, three different sized plas-
tic balls were used.  In Figure 14E, the
three plastic disks could only be moved
horizontally.  In Figure 14H, three
sponge balls of different colors (red,
green, yellow) were used.
Design
This was a mixed design.  The
within-subject factor was the ordinal
dimension.  It had three levels: size, lo-
cation, and color.  The between-subject
factor was the nominal dimension.  It
also had three levels: size, location, and
color.  There were three games across
the three within-subject levels at each
between-subject level.  Each subject
played these three games once in a ran-
domized order (e.g., O(color)-N(size),
O(size)-N(size), 
and 
O(location)-
N(size)).  For the three games at each be-
tween-subject level, there were six pos-
sible permutations.  There were a total
of 18 possible permutations across the
three between-subject levels.  Each
permutation was assigned to two sub-
jects randomly.  There were a total of 36
subjects.  Due to a limitation in the
number of subjects available, the start-
ing and ending positions were not ran-
domized.  That is, for each subject, the

--- Page 26 ---

26
first game always started at position S1
and ended at position E1 (see Figure 3),
the second at position S2 and at position
E2, and the third at position S3 and at
position E3.  The starting and ending
positions were not expected to cause
much systematic deviation because the
three pairs of starting and ending posi-
tions were exactly symmetric, and the
three games played by each subject were
randomized.
Procedure
For each game, the subjects were
asked to read the instructions aloud
once and given two minutes to memo-
rize the rules.  The subjects were then
asked to recite all the rules.  If the sub-
jects could recite all the rules without
errors, they were shown two examples
for each rule.  Otherwise, the subjects
read the instructions again and were
again tested until  they could recite all
the rules without errors.  Before the
subjects started the games, they were
given the initial and final states.  The
final state for each game was presented
by a set of identical objects.  Subjects'
hand movements and speech were
recorded by a video camera.
Results
The solution times, steps, and errors are
shown in Figure 16.  The p values are
shown in Table 3.  For the ordinal di-
mension, when solution times and er-
rors were used as the difficulty mea-
surement, locations were significantly
better than sizes and colors.   Though
the solution times and errors for sizes
were smaller than for colors, the differ-
ences were not statistically significant.
When solution steps were used as the
difficulty measurement, locations were
significantly better than sizes, but not
statistically better than colors, though
the solution steps for locations were
fewer than for colors.  The difference of
solution steps between colors and sizes
was not statistically significant.
For the nominal dimension, when
solution times and errors were used as
the difficulty measurement, locations
were significantly better than sizes and
colors.  The difference between sizes
and colors was not statistically signifi-
cant.  When solution steps were used as
the difficulty measurement, none of the
differences between sizes, locations, and
colors were statistically significant,
though solution steps for locations were
fewer than for sizes and colors.
Discussion
We identified two factors that might af-
fect problem solving behavior at the
level of dimensional representations.
The first factor is whether the ordinal
dimensional is represented internally
or externally.  The results showed that
although solution times and errors for
colors, which represent the ordinal di-
mension internally, were larger than
for sizes, which represent the ordinal
dimension externally, the differences
were not statistically significant.  This
might be because, compared with  other
mental activities during the problem
solving tasks, internalizing the color
priority (red>green>yellow) was a triv-
ial task.  The second factor, whether a
dimension is represented by visual or
spatial properties, played a major role in
determining 
problem 
difficulties.
Locations were much better than sizes
for the ordinal dimension and than
sizes and colors for the nominal dimen-
sion.  The superiority of locations over
colors for the ordinal dimension was an
effect caused by both factors.

Why were locations so special?  In
the analysis of the dimensional repre-
sentations of the TOH, we reviewed
some empirical studies showing the
important anatomical and functional
differences between visual and spatial
representations (Goldman-Rakic 1992;
Mishkin, Ungerleider, & Macko 1983;
Treisman & Gelade, 1980).  Though the
results from the present experiment do
not allow us to offer a direct explana-
tion of why locations (spatial dimen-
sion) were better than sizes and colors
(visual dimensions), we can compare
our results with some perceptual tasks.
The ordinal and nominal dimensions
in the present experiment are conjunc-
tive dimensions.  Treisman & Gelade
(1980) proposed that location informa-
tion is necessary for the perception of
conjunctive stimuli.  Nissen's (1985)
study of conjunctive stimuli based on
visual maps is more directly related to
the present study.  According to her,
color and shape are registered in sepa-
rate maps.  When a conjunctive stimu-
lus was composed of color and location,
she showed that selecting an item by
color and reporting its location was as
accurate as selecting by location and re-
porting color.  In this case, selection by
location did not have special advantage,
because location itself was part of the
conjunctive stimulus.  However, when
a conjunctive stimulus is composed of
color and shape, location is necessary
for cross-referencing between the sepa-
rate shape and color maps.  She showed
that when subjects reported the shape
and location of an item cued by its color,
the accuracy of shape judgments de-
pended on the accuracy of locating the
cued color.  Comparing Nissen's study
with the present study, we have parallel
results.  If neither of the two conjunc-
tive dimensions (ordinal and nominal
dimensions) is represented by locations,
an extra step of invoking location in-
formation is needed to link the two
separate visual maps of size and color.
In this case, the three values on the or-
dinal dimension and the three values
on the nominal dimensions, as well as
the three locations, have  to be checked
before an operation (moving or rotat-
ing) can be made.  If one of the two con-
junctive dimensions is represented by
locations, the extra step of invoking the
location information is not needed, be-
cause the location information itself is
in the conjunctive dimensions.  In this
case, only the three values on the di-
mension not represented by locations
and the three values on the dimension
of locations have to be checked before
an operation can be made.  Thus, if one
of the ordinal and nominal dimensions
or both of them are represented by loca-
tions, the problem is easier.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
In this paper, we developed a theoreti-
cal framework of distributed representa-
tions and a methodology of representa-
tional analysis for the study of dis-
tributed cognitive tasksÑtasks that re-
quire the processing of information dis-
tributed across the internal mind and
the external environment, and applied
them to the empirical studies of the
Tower of Hanoi problem.  Our approach
to distributed cognitive tasks demands
(a) the consideration of the internal and
external representations of a task as a
representational system, (b) the explicit
decomposition of the representational
system into its internal and external
components, and (c) the identification
of the different functions of internal
and external representations in cogni-

--- Page 29 ---

29
tion.  The traditional approach to cogni-
tion is not appropriate for the study of
distributed cognitive tasks, because it of-
ten ignores the important functions of
external representations in cognition.
In addition, it often confuses a task's
distributed representation that has both
internal and external components with
the task's internal representation. This
confusion often leads to unnecessarily
complex accounts of cognition.
Formal Structures, Representations ,
and Processes
Any distributed cognitive task can be
analyzed into three aspects: its formal
structure, its representation, and its pro-
cesses.   Our present study focused on
representations and their relation to
formal structures, for the following rea-
sons.  First, in order to understand the
processes involved in a distributed cog-
nitive task, we first have to understand
what information is processed and how
the information to be processed is rep-
resented.  Second, different processes
are  activated by different  representa-
tions, but not vice versa.  For example,
perceptual processes are activated by ex-
ternal representations, while cognitive
processes are usually activated by inter-
nal representations.  Third, from a rep-
resentational perspective, tasks that
look dramatically different may in fact
have a common structure.  However, if
we start our analysis with processes, we
may fail to capture this common struc-
ture, because different representational
formats of the common structure can
activate completely different processes.
The three aspects of distributed
cognitive tasks are closely interrelated:
the same formal structure can be im-
plemented by different isomorphic rep-
resentations, and different isomorphic
representations can activate different
processes.  Though an representational
analysis should be the first step for the
study of distributed cognitive tasks, a
process model is also essential.  In order
to understand the nature of distributed
cognitive tasks, we need to study all of
the three aspects.  Two interesting is-
sues worth of further studies are the re-
lationship between representations and
processes and the interplay between
perceptual and cognitive processes.
The Nature of External Representations
External objects are not just peripheral
aids to cognition, they provide a differ-
ent form of representationÑan external
representation.  By decomposing the
representational system of a distributed
cognitive task into its internal and ex-
ternal representations, we can separate
the functions of external representa-
tions from those of internal representa-
tions.  The empirical studies reported
here on the Tower of Hanoi problem
suggest the following properties of ex-
ternal representations.
1.  External representations can
provide memory aids.  For example, in
all of the TOH experiments reported
here, the goal problem states didn't
need to be memorized, because they
were placed in front of the subjects ei-
ther by diagrams or by physical objects.
This is the most acknowledged property
of external representations.  To many
people, this is the only one.
2.  External representations can
provide information that can be directly
perceived and used without being in-
terpreted and formulated explicitly.  For
example, in the I1-E23 version of the
TOH, Rules 2 and 3 were not told to the
subjects: they were built into the physi-
cal constraints.  They could be perceived
and followed directly by the subjects.
When the subjects were asked to explic-

--- Page 30 ---
Distributed Cognitive Tasks
30
itly formulate the rules after the games,
few could do it.  External representa-
tions seem to provide affordances
(Gibson, 1979).
3.  External representations can an-
chor and structure cognitive behavior.
The physical structures in external rep-
resentations constrain the range of  pos-
sible cognitive behaviors in the sense
that some behaviors are allowed and
others prohibited.  For example, in the
I1-E23 version of the TOH, external
Rules 2 and 3 could not be violated.
They constructed an action space in
which only the actions that did not vio-
late these two rules were permitted.
This action space is the external prob-
lem space of the I1-E23 problem.
4.  External representations change
the nature of a task.  Norman (1991)
proposed that there are two different
views of cognitive artifacts.  From the
system's view (internal + external rep-
resentations), external representations
can make a task easier; from the per-
son's view (internal representations
only), external representations change
the nature of the task.  For example, in
the I123 version of the TOH, a subject
had to process three internal rules,
while in the I1-E23 version the subject
only had to process one internal rule.
Though the two versions had the same
abstract structure, their cognitive pro-
cesses were different.  Nevertheless,
when considered as systems, I1-E23 was
much easier than I123.
5.  External representations are an
indispensable part of the representa-
tional system of any distributed cogni-
tive task.   This property is a direct re-
flection of the nature of distributed cog-
nitive tasks, which require the process-
ing of information distributed across in-
ternal and external representations.
Related Approaches
Although the mainstream approach to
cognition has focused on internal repre-
sentations, the role of the environment
in cognition has long been acknowl-
edged by several alternative approaches.
For example, Gibson (1966, 1979) argued
that perception is the direct pickup of
e n v i r o n m e n t a l  
i n f o r m a t i o n
(invariants) in the extended spatial and
temporal patterns of optic arrays, and
that information in the environment is
sufficient for perception and action. The
sociohistorical approach to cognition
(Leontiev, 1981; Luria, 1976; Vygotsgy,
1978, 1986) argues that it is the continu-
ous internalization of the information
and structure from the environment
and the externalization of internal rep-
resentations into the environment that
produce high level psychological func-
tions.
More recently, the role of the envi-
ronment in cognition has become the
central concern in several fields of cog-
nitive science.  In the studies of the rela-
tionship between images and pictures, it
has been shown that external represen-
tations can give us access to knowledge
and skills that are unavailable from in-
ternal representations (e.g., Chambers &
Reisberg, 1985; Reisberg, 1987).   The sit-
uated cognition approach argues that
the activities of individuals are situated
in the social and physical contexts
around them and knowledge can be
considered as a relation between the in-
dividuals and the situation (e.g.,
Barwise & Perry, 1983; Greeno, 1989;
Lewis, 1991; Suchman, 1987).  Studies
on diagrammatic reasoning have also
focused on the functions of external
representations in cognition (e.g.,
Chandrasekaran & Narayanan, 1990;
Larkin, 1989; Larkin & Simon, 1987).
For example, Larkin & Simon (1987) ar-

--- Page 31 ---
Distributed Cognitive Tasks
31
gue that diagrammatic representations
support operators that can recognize
features easily and make inferences di-
rectly.
Although our current approach
shares the same interest with others in
the function of the environment in
cognition, it differs in several aspects.
First, our approach focuses on the rep-
resentational properties of distributed
cognitive tasks: how the information
needed for a distributed cognitive task is
represented across the internal mind
and the external environment.  Second,
our approach demands the considera-
tion of the internal and external repre-
sentations of a distributed cognitive task
as a representational system.  We argue
that external representations are an in-
dispensable part of any distributed cog-
nitive task.  Third, our approach de-
mands the explicit decomposition of the
representational system of a distributed
cognitive task into its internal and ex-
ternal components.  With such a de-
composition, we can identify the differ-
ent functions of internal and external
representations in cognition.  Fourth,
we suggested that in order to under-
stand the nature of a distributed cogni-
tive task, we need to study the task's
formal structure, representation, and
processes and the interrelations among
them.  Finally, the principles of dis-
tributed representations and the
methodology of representational analy-
sis developed in the present study have
been applied to several real world prob-
lems, including numeration systems,
relational information displays, and
cockpit instrument displays (Zhang,
1992).
Conclusion
The distributed representations ap-
proach offers a novel perspective for the
study of cognition.  It has both theoreti-
cal 
and 
practical 
implications.
Theoretically, it can shed light on some
issues regarding the nature of cognition,
such as whether cognition is solely in
the mind or distributed across the mind
and the environment and whether
people reason on formal structures or
on content-specific representations.
